00001.wav,Chinese,"In the winter of 2021, I went back to my hometown to visit my grandmother. He was not in good health that year and lived in a small town hospital not far from the village. The winter wind was particularly biting, and I carried a bag of fruits that he liked to eat and walked into the hospital. When my grandmother saw me, a long lost smile appeared on her face. She said, 'How did you know that what I wanted the most was oranges?'? We talked a lot in the ward, and I asked him how his treatment was? But he always changes the topic and talks about recent events at home, such as the newly built house and the few fruit trees planted. I can see that he is trying hard to show strength, but I can also feel the exhaustion that cannot be hidden in his eyes. In the afternoon, I pushed his wheelchair to the garden behind the hospital. The winter sunshine was light, but it made people feel warm. Grandma quietly looked at the withered yellow leaves and suddenly asked me, do you think time passes too quickly? I didn't answer. Because I also have the same feeling. He began to tell stories from his youth, about how he carried my mother over a mountain to find a job, and how he managed to farm and support his family during the most difficult times. As I listened to these stories, I suddenly felt very guilty. I felt guilty that I always felt busy with work and didn't have time to come back to see him, but she never complained that I didn't come home often. When I left the hospital, I turned around and looked at her in the garden. The sunlight was shining on her white hair, and I thought to myself that no matter how busy I was in the future, I would come back to see her often because companionship was what she needed most."
00002.wav,Chinese,"I finally realized my dream of traveling to Yunnan during the summer vacation of 2022. The beautiful scenery and unique culture of Yunnan have always been my dream, and this trip has deeply impressed me with its charm. The most unforgettable day for me was riding by the Erhai Lake. The feeling of freedom and tranquility is still unforgettable to this day. In the early morning, I rented a bicycle from Dali Old City and rode along the lakeside path of Erhai Lake. The water of Erhai Lake was as calm as a mirror in the early morning, reflecting the surrounding green mountains and the white clouds in the sky. The breeze gently blew, the lake began to ripple, and the sun shone on the water. The whole picture seemed to come out of the painting. I take photos while riding my bike, occasionally stopping to appreciate the beautiful scenery in front of me. Along the way, I met many tourists who rode the same bike, some from the south and some from abroad. Everyone was impressed by the peaceful beauty of Erhai Lake. At noon, I stopped at a small restaurant by the lake and tasted authentic Yunnan cuisine, especially the local roasted milk fan. It was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, with a strong milk aroma that left an unforgettable taste. In the afternoon, I continued cycling and enjoyed different angles of Erhai Lake along the way. In some places, I could see fishing boats slowly gliding over the lake, while in others, I was surrounded by rice paddies and small mountain villages. Every scenery was unforgettable. In the evening, I sat down at the observation deck by the Erhai Lake. The sunset dyed the entire lake red, and the scene of fishing boats returning home was quiet and beautiful. I felt an unprecedented sense of tranquility and satisfaction. This trip not only allowed me to see the beauty of Erhai Lake, but also taught me how to find inner peace in life."
00003.wav,Chinese,"This is my story. My journey begins with the famous Forbidden City, which is the largest and most well preserved imperial palace complex in the world. When I stepped into the huge red palace gate, it was as if I had traveled through history. The exquisite carvings, magnificent roofs, and vast courtyards showcased the grandeur of the Ming and Qing dynasties. When visiting the Hall of Supreme Harmony and the Imperial Garden, I was fascinated by the architectural craftsmanship and rich history here. Then I went to the Bathing Field section of the Great Wall, which is not far from the city center. This section of the Great Wall is famous for its magnificent scenery and fewer tourists. Although the climbing process was arduous, standing at the top and gazing at the stretching mountains and the long Great Wall, all exhaustion vanished into thin air. Standing on this ancient defense project, I felt a shock that lasted for thousands of years. Returning to the city center, I visited Tiananmen Square, which is one of the largest squares in the world. The magnificent scale of the square is breathtaking, and I spent some time contemplating its cultural and historical significance. Not far away, I also attended and visited the Temple of Heaven, a masterpiece of Ming Dynasty architecture. The circular Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests is both magnificent and symbolizes the concept of unity between heaven and man. The cuisine in Beijing is equally impressive. I tasted the famous Beijing roast duck, a delicacy that has been passed down for a hundred years and left a lasting impression on me. The chef skillfully sliced it, and the crispy duck skin and tender duck meat paired it with pancakes and sweet sauce, making it a feast for the taste buds. At night, I strolled through the bustling alleys, which showcased the traditional side of Beijing. The snack stalls and specialty shops on the streets of Xiaoyuanzi made me feel the authentic and leisurely life of the locals. Beijing is a city full of contrasts, where ancient traditions and modern innovation intertwine. Every moment is like a wonderful story, and I am fortunate to be a part of it."
00004.wav,Chinese,"In 2020, I registered for the school's organized study tour in the United States. I participated in this trip with two other classmates and many teachers and classmates. On January 15, we arrived in New York, the United States, and the rest of the trip was by bus. I had a very rich breakfast with my classmates. It was a Chinese restaurant. Breakfast included dumplings, dumplings, Congee, and Mantou that I was familiar with. Then I took the bus to see the American scenery along the bus. I saw a Starbucks in the United States and a Gothic style building in the car, and I even took photos to commemorate it. Afterwards, my classmates and I came to Columbia University for a tour. The university square is very spacious, with sunlight shining on the lawn, which is very pleasing to the eye. It was winter at the time, so we walked around Columbia University wearing down jackets. I saw the unique buildings of different colleges, including the Philosophy and Law schools. I also saw pigeons walking on the ground, which was a very harmonious and beautiful scene. The statue of Athena, the goddess of wisdom at Columbia University, is very dignified and solemn. After the visit to the university, my classmates, teachers, and I took a group photo in front of this statue as a memento. Afterwards, we took a bus to Wall Street and I touched the famous golden bull statue. I heard that touching its horns can bring me wealth, which is also a beautiful symbolism. I also took a photo in front of this golden bull statue as a souvenir. Afterwards, I took a cruise with my team to observe the Statue of Liberty. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have felt its magnificence and beauty. Indeed, the feeling that pictures give people is completely different from what they see with their own eyes. Seeing this girl on site was truly spectacular. He held the torch high in the sunlight, as if fighting for freedom. Uh huh. I stayed in the United States for a total of 7 days before returning home. It was really an exciting and meaningful trip, I think."
00005.wav,Chinese,"Today, I would like to share with you my trip to Shaanxi last year. As I stepped onto this ancient land, my heart was filled with anticipation and awe. My first stop on my trip to Shaanxi was Xi'an, a thousand year old ancient capital that seems to narrate the vicissitudes of history. Walking on the walls of the ancient city, I feel like I can hear the echoes of history, and every brick and stone carries the weight of history. Walking into the Terra Cotta Warriors Museum, I felt the hegemony and glory of Qin Shihuang's unification of the six countries with the rows of lifelike terracotta warriors. Then I arrived at Tsinghua Palace, which was once a witness to the love between Emperor Xuanzong of Tang and Yang Guifei. Walking by the hot springs, I felt as if I could see the scene of them playing here back then and feel the romance that spans thousands of years. Of course, Shaanxi cuisine is also not to be missed. A bowl of hot Pita bread soaked in Lamb Soup let me taste the local authentic flavor. The rich soup, fresh mutton, and crispy modules make me have endless aftertaste. This trip to Shaanxi made me deeply feel the breadth and depth of Chinese civilization. From the ancient city walls to the spectacular Terra Cotta Warriors, from the romantic Qinghua Palace to the delicious Pita bread soaked in Lamb Soup, every place in the United States of Shaanxi makes me linger. In this land of Shanxi, not only did I appreciate the weight of history, but I also felt the charm of Chinese culture. I believe that everyone who comes to Shaanxi will be impressed by the charm here. Every person who comes to Shaanxi will once again hope to come to this historic city within their lifetime."
00006.wav,Chinese,"I have visited Nanjing several times within a year, it is truly a beautiful city. My best friend went to school there. We ate in the snack street outside the school gate, walked between the Yihe Road, and rode under the city wall set off by wutong trees. Nanjing satisfied me with its scenery, climate, and culture. For someone who grew up in the north, Nanjing is the most beautiful image of a southern city in their imagination. Uh huh. Wandering on Yihe Road in the most beautiful season, the sunshine shines through the gaps of the leaves on a sunny day, casting mottled light and shadow on the stone bricks. These buildings come from the period of the Republic of China, just like the endless wutong trees on the road, they really deserve the reputation of half of the history of the Republic of China along the Yi River. Nanjing is a city that connects ancient and modern times, and its profound cultural heritage has been well preserved. On its side, towering skyscrapers rise during the day and on the white ground, creating a beautiful modern urban skyline."
00007.wav,Chinese,"Last autumn during the National Day holiday, I went to Hangzhou to interview a friend I hadn't seen in many years. This trip was very special for me because Hangzhou is a place I've always wanted to go to but haven't. And this friend from Hangzhou is my high school classmate. Since we started college, we have been busy on our own and haven't seen each other again. That morning, as I sat outside the high-speed train window in Hangzhou, the scenery gradually changed from a bustling city to lush mountains and clear waters. Along the way, I was full of anticipation. When I arrived in Hangzhou, my friend picked me up at the station. At the moment we met, we both smiled, as if we were back in high school. He took me to the old street he recommended, which is a very quiet pedestrian street lined with old houses and small shops. He said it preserves his memories of two years in college and is one of his favorite places. Let's first make the sweet and fragrant osmanthus lotus root powder of Heliwan hot on the street, and then feel the warmth of home. I slowly walked on the old street and looked at the small stalls selling handicrafts. My friend told me a story about what happened during his two years of college here. He said he didn't always come when he was sad or happy. This pedestrian street is for relaxing and leisure activities. I looked at his smile as if I could see what he looked like on this street at the time. In the afternoon, we went to West Lake, and the willows by the lake had already turned slightly yellow. The lake was shimmering with golden light in the sunlight. We rented a small boat and slid slowly to the center of the lake, where the wind was light and cool. It seemed like we had talked a lot about his college life and hobbies, as well as his plans for the future. We also talked about the days in high school when we stayed up late together and went out to play with our backs. Time passed quickly, as the sunset gradually set and the lake was dyed orange red. That night, we had dinner at a small restaurant by the lake. Although it was just a home cooked meal, it was particularly delicious with the company of old friends. After dinner, we took a walk by the lake, watching the distant lights reflecting on the surface of the lake, like countless stars scattered in the water. I took a deep breath and felt that the tranquility and beauty of this moment would forever remain in my memory."
00008.wav,Chinese,"On a sunny weekend, I decided to visit my childhood friend Xiaoyu. Ah, it's been several years since we last met, and my heart is filled with anticipation and tension. Well, maybe it's also a kind of longing for him. When I walked into his house, I almost felt the atmosphere of playing together back then. Um, our people here are in charge. Friends who have been playing like this since childhood are called hairdressers. Ah, this feeling is very wonderful. Hmm, it's like looking at each other since childhood, watching each other grow up together. And this photo on the wall still captures countless happy moments we had back then. Um, then I saw Xiaoyu walking out of his bedroom. We smiled at each other, and for some reason, our past happiness surged in our hearts, but at the same time, there was also a hint of melancholy mixed in. We have indeed grown up and can't go back. Well, things are no longer that simple now. We sat on the balcony chatting about childhood anecdotes. He mentioned that we used to catch fish by the small river together, and the sound of cicadas echoed in the summer afternoon. I couldn't help but laugh out loud, but at that moment, I felt a little sad again. Time had passed, and we could never go back to that carefree age. We now had our own studies and had to work hard for our own things. Well, the people and things we come into contact with now are also different, and I feel that there may be a sad and thick barrier between us. I think it's a sad thing, but there's nothing we can do about it. As I bid farewell, I suddenly felt a complex emotion in my heart, both the joy of reunion and the nostalgia for the past. This visit made me understand that although time has changed everything, those beautiful memories still remain in my heart and become an indelible part of my life."
00009.wav,Chinese,"Last year, I went on a trip to Venice, Italy, which was my dream trip. Finally, I had the opportunity to personally experience the charm of this water city. I embarked on this journey with a few friends, and when we first arrived in this city, we were deeply impressed by the scenery before us. The streets of Venice are not traditional streets, but winding waterways that recreate the ancient architecture surrounding them, like a scroll into history. We eagerly boarded the traditional Venetian small boat, the Gondola, and slowly sailed through the waterway. The boatman skillfully slid his feet, leading us through the complex of buildings with a strong sense of history. The sunset reflected on the water, adding a few golden rays to the surrounding scenery. The entire city appeared peaceful and mysterious. In addition to the tour of Dogongdora, we also visited St. Mark's Square, which is one of the most famous squares in Venice. The square was bustling with people, and flocks of pigeons flew in the air, occasionally landing on the ground, attracting tourists to feed them. Surrounding the square are magnificent buildings, with the golden dome of St. Mark's Church shining brightly in the sunlight. At the Church of Santa Maria del Fiore, on the other side and in the square, we met an artist who painted portraits of tourists. I asked him to paint a portrait for me, and the artist smiled and gently touched me, beginning to depict it in detail. Painting is filled with the aroma of coffee and melodious music. I am quietly waiting, and after painting, the artist hands me the portrait. The me in the painting looks more vivid and interesting than the real me. This encounter left a deep impression on me. In this historic city, all moments seem to carry a mysterious color, especially those unexpected interludes that make travel more real and unforgettable."
00010.wav,Chinese,"In the autumn of 2021, I visited a long lost friend named Xiao Jun. Xiaojuan was my best friend during my college years, and we spent many wonderful times together. At that time, we often stayed up late together to review, discuss our life ideals, and dream of exploring the world together after graduation. However, after graduation, we embarked on different paths and gradually lost touch. Every time I think of him, I feel a bit regretful, but we all know that life always takes people further and further away. Until one day, I received a message from his family that Xiaojuan was seriously ill and in a very bad condition. Upon hearing this news, my heart was filled with helplessness and anxiety, and I decided to go see him as soon as possible. When I arrived at Xiaojun's house, I saw him lying on the hospital bed, so thin that I could hardly recognize him. Although he forced a smile, there was a deep exhaustion in his eyes. We sat in front of his hospital bed, chatting about the time we spent together before. He gently said that he had been waiting for me to come and see him because he knew I wouldn't leave him behind. Nike, I feel like there's a stone pressing down on my heart, unable to breathe. Xiao Jun handed me a notebook and said it was written by him during this period, which recorded his memories of the past, our friendship, and his helplessness towards the future. He said that if one day he left on his own, he hoped that I could remember him and also remember the beauty of the past. Upon hearing these words, I could hardly control my tears, but I could only try my best to appear strong and whisper that you would definitely get better. That night, we sat side by side in the yard, listening to the distant bell and wind. The air was a bit cold, but he still didn't want me to leave and held me back. I promised him that I wouldn't come back to see him again next time. However, when we said goodbye, I had no chance to say those words to him that you must be in such a miserable situation again. A few months later, Xiaozhen passed away. When I received the news, my heart was empty, as if I had lost a friend who could never be added back. I opened the notebook he left for me and read those words, as if everything was so real and yet so distant with him by my side. Every time I see those agreements about him, my heart surges with pain. Perhaps we always learn to cherish after losing."

In my heart, the sea is a dream, a world full of blue and waves. Last summer, my friends and I planned a trip to Hainan and finally had the opportunity to fulfill our dream. When the plane landed at Sanya Airport, I couldn't wait to head towards the beach. The next morning, we got up early and drove to Sanya Bay. As the car approached the coastline, I saw a deep blue ocean appear before my eyes. Its vastness and calmness made me hold my breath. The sunshine sprinkled on the sea surface, like a layer of gold powder. My friends and I couldn't wait to get off the car and stepped on the soft sand, feeling the delicate touch of sand sliding through our fingers. But by the beach, I heard the real sound of waves for the first time. The sound was both majestic and gentle, like a symphony of nature. My friends cheered while rushing towards the sea, and I rolled up my pants and cautiously walked in. The cool sea water soaked my ankles, and the waves lightly hit my skin, bringing an indescribable joy and novelty. We also rented a small boat to go out to sea, and the captain told us that dolphins can often be seen near the sea. After sailing on the sea for a while, several dolphins jumping in the distance caught our attention, and everyone exclaimed excitedly, eagerly picking up their phones to take photos. That day, we also tried beach volleyball and crab catching, and every moment was filled with laughter and excitement. As night fell, we sat on the beach watching the sunset. The orange red sunset dyed the sea golden, and the scenery was so beautiful that I didn't want to leave.

00012.wav,Chinese,"This summer there was a World Cup held, and the team I support is Germany. Germany's performance in recent years has not been very good, so the outside world generally does not have a good view of them. However, I still support the German team because they have many players that I like, and I have been supporting the German team since 10 years ago. Mmm hmm. Well, in this year's group stage, the German team lost their first game to the very strong Spanish team in the same group, which cast a shadow on the fans of the German team and their psychology. However, in the following two matches, Germany, Lynk&Co, Japan, and Belgium successfully advanced to the next round as the second place team in the group. In the knockout stage of the quarter finals, the German team faced another group, the first Argentina, in their second group. The German team ultimately ended the game with a score of 4-0. Well, this score is undoubtedly a lot played. The fans who are not optimistic about the face of the German team, because the German team advanced to the quarter finals with a very beautiful victory. Then, in the quarterfinals, they went cold and defeated the favorite Brazilian team 2-1, successfully advancing to the quarterfinals. They also defeated the group stage team, which they had previously lost to, and the Spanish team, which they had previously lost to in the group stage. Eventually, they advanced to the finals, which made many people think that the German team was a dark horse in this World Cup. However, I believe that the German team only showed their normal strength. In the final, the German team faced the former World Cup champion Italy, but their skills have also declined in recent years. Faced with the fierce attack of the German team, the Italian team ultimately lost the game 0-3. The German team finally lifted the long-awaited trophy and won the World Cup. This makes me very happy because I support the German team. I am very happy that they won the championship. So this is my story."

It was a sunny afternoon, and I decided to explore the city center and enjoy the charm of this city. However, due to insufficient route planning in advance, I got lost on a strange street, my phone ran out of battery and couldn't be used, and to make matters worse, I don't understand French at all, so I don't know how to communicate with the locals. I stood on the roadside feeling a bit flustered and didn't know what to do. Just as I was feeling anxious, a middle-aged man walked up to me. He looked very friendly, wearing simple clothes and smiling. Seeing that I was a bit confused, he took the initiative to ask if I needed help. Seeing his smile, I felt a sense of peace of mind. So I told him that I was lost, my phone was out of battery, and I couldn't find my way back to the hotel. He smiled and said, 'No problem, come with me.'.

He even sat down with me to chat and buy me a cup of coffee. Although we didn't speak the same language, we successfully established communication through body language and smiles. At this moment, I feel like I am no longer a lonely tourist, but rather receiving warm care from others. Through this experience, I deeply understand that kindness between people transcends culture and language. Sometimes a stranger's smile and kindness can make us feel incredibly warm and grounded. That stranger not only helped me solve the problem, but also made me believe again that friendship between people can be easily established in unfamiliar environments."

00038.wav,Chinese,"Well, a few classmates and I drove to Changbai Mountain by road in the summer of 2017, so the journey was quite long. The scenery along the way was intertwined and varied, with trees, railways, grasslands, and occasionally a few small rivers. We talked and laughed along the way, so the journey was not particularly boring. The first thing we did when we arrived in Jilin Province was to taste the local iron pot stew. Although iron pot stew is more enjoyable to eat in winter, we still had to take a bite even after going there. In the summer, we were sweating profusely due to the stuffiness. The carefully prepared sauce and various side dishes were boiled and wrapped in a large pancake, and we still couldn't stop thinking about the rice. Later, we went to Changbai Mountain again because the cool weather there allowed us to briefly escape from Beijing's steam ovens. The scenery was beautiful, with lush forests and fresh air. We wandered between clouds and mist, feeling like we were in a fairyland. Then there were a few eagles hovering and flying over the mountain spring on the side, as if they had received a hug from nature. Afterwards, we went to Northeast barbecue, where grilled skewers were a major specialty. It is said that there are no Northeasterners who can't barbecue skewers. The meat and dishes are very sincere, and the fire control is just right. Unlike the thin and hard skewers made by street vendors, the skewers we ate can be described as fresh, fragrant, and delicious, with alternating fat and thin, steaming hot, and making a slight sizzling sound. I still drool when I think about it now. Then we also tried several local specialty dishes, such as the Three Fresh Pot Pork and the Slippery Pork Section. Although these dishes can be found in takeout from various places, we can only taste the most authentic flavor in Northeast China. When stir fried on the table, you can still bring out enamel coated pork belly, which looks like a dark plate of ground three fresh dishes. However, each dish is coated with a sauce that has been thickened, making it a perfect complement to the meal. The prices of the dishes there are relatively cheap, and there is no shortage of food. The bosses are very enthusiastic, and during the waiting period, they even give us homemade pickled vegetables or appetizers, and chat with us about our daily lives. In our communication with the boss, even our accents have become a bit Northeastern, indicating that Northeastern has a greater impact on people's accents. This trip was a journey of playfulness and relaxation while standing on Changbai Mountain, as well as the ultimate enjoyment brought by authentic Northeastern cuisine. It can be considered a journey of enjoyment or healing."

But this time, what's different is that I'm studying here, so I don't need to take the high-speed train. We played for about a week. At first, we planned to join a group tour, but after thinking about it, we decided to choose a customized tour called Ctrip because we took care of many elderly people and children in the team. I remember it cost several tens of thousands of yuan to charter a car, which was quite expensive. However, the experience was not that good because some bad things happened during the group tour. For example, due to some traffic restrictions and vehicles, the car we booked couldn't arrive at our place in time. Also, the driver may have been a bit lazy and didn't want to pick us up. So although he gave him money, he didn't give it to us. We worked diligently, and in the end, Ctrip also provided us with some compensation. Well, you're asking me if I'm happy driving, right? Well, it's just so so, because although he compensated me, I still felt a little weak. Finally, we went to many places, including Peking University, the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, and many other places. Then I found that many places were not very good at grabbing tickets. I had to work hard to grab tickets. The place that impressed me most was Universal Studios. Well, Universal Studios was very interesting. There were many unique movie characters of Zhan Huan, and some other things in it. It was very interesting. Uh huh. Um, I remember on the last day, we went to the Forbidden City. Actually, I didn't think it was suitable to go there on the last day, but it was still the last day because you know it's difficult to grab tickets. So on the last day when I went to the Forbidden City, I remember there were still people wearing the emperor's clothes going in to take photos. I think this idea is quite novel. Uh huh. Overall, it was a pretty good trip, but there were also some bad things. Because you know Ctrip's drivers are a bit lazy, so this is my story."

00042.wav,Chinese,"Ah, that was a day full of anticipation. Ah, I finally went to the United States to participate in an NBA game in person. Not only that, but I also got a chance to meet basketball superstar LeBron James. It all sounded like a dream, but when I stood in front of the Staples Center in Los Angeles, I couldn't believe my eyes. I have always been a loyal fan of James. Since the season he first entered the league, I have been following his games and witnessing his glorious journey from Cleveland to Miami, back to Cleveland, and finally joining the Los Angeles Lakers to win multiple championships. Being able to see him with my own eyes and even communicate with him face-to-face is an unparalleled honor for me. I arrived at the game venue early that day, and the atmosphere was filled with excitement and tension. The Lakers were about to face the Warriors, and fans gathered outside the door excitedly discussing game predictions and player performances. Finally, the staff took me into an area specially prepared for the media and VIP guests, where I could observe the team's preparation process up close. As I walked into the hallway of the players' locker room, I suddenly heard heavy footsteps. I turned around and saw the basketball superstar LeBron James, whom I had admired since childhood. He was wearing a Lakers training uniform and holding a bottle of water in his hand, walking towards the training ground. Although he looked very focused, when he saw me, he smiled slightly and seemed to be familiar with me. We started discussing basketball and also talked about his personal life. He told me that besides the challenges of the basketball court, family and social responsibility are the most important parts of his life. He mentioned that as an athlete, he sometimes faces tremendous pressure, but he always believes that with the support and unremitting efforts of the team, all difficulties can be overcome. I asked him, during your long career, when did you feel the most proud? James and Chen Slupanik smiled slightly and answered, 'My greatest pride is being able to bring back that championship trophy for my hometown Cleveland. It was the result of our team's hard work and the most unforgettable moment of my career.'. Winning the championship is not just for myself, but for the fans and people in my hometown who have always supported me. In just a short conversation, James left a deep impression on me. His humility and focus, as well as his love for basketball, far exceeded what I knew of him. He is not only a superstar on the court, but also full of water management and human touch off the court. When I said goodbye to her, I felt an indescribable sense of satisfaction. Being able to communicate face-to-face with great athletes like James was one of the most precious experiences of my life. Although I know that people like James may only meet once in their lives, his focused and passionate spirit will always inspire me to constantly pursue my dreams. The game began, and I sat on the sidelines, my eyes fixed on every moment on the ball. James' performance on the court was as stunning as usual, and in that moment off the court, his sincerity and humility deeply touched me. That's all thank you。"

We went to another city in Shaanxi Province, Baoji City, because we considered that there were too many people in Xi'an and holidays, so we went to other cities. And he was already tired of visiting Xi'an, so we unanimously decided to go to a new place, Baoji City. We bought station tickets back and forth from Xi'an to Baoji, mainly because the hard seats were sold out. Baoji is indeed an 18 tier small city, and hotels of the same specifications are several times more expensive in Beijing. When we arrived at the station, what we saw was desolation. We saw the roads and high-rise buildings under construction, and sure enough, the ride hailing services here were very inconvenient and difficult to book, but taxis were also too expensive. So we took the bus out to play, which was also run down. It was still very hot in summer, and we didn't even want to turn on the air conditioning inside the bus. The only place worth visiting was the Bronze Museum. When we arrived at the Bronze Museum, we were already very tired. Although the Bronze Museum looked particularly magnificent, we didn't have the energy to visit anymore. So we found a seat to rest for a while, and the mood to visit was gone. In the end, we took a quick look and the only thing that left the deepest impression on us was his tripod like appearance. Then we went back to the hotel. As soon as we arrived, we didn't want to go out and hadn't seen each other for a long time. So we stayed in the hotel for two days, playing games. We took a nap during the day, ordered takeout until noon, and played games until late at night. On this trip, we went to a bronze museum. Finally, when we left, we went to the bustling night market and wanted to eat some snacks to make up for our regret. However, the homogenization of snacks here was too severe and there was no distinctive feature. After a long wait for roasted pig trotters, the taste was mediocre and can only be described as tasteless. Minxin, who we have been waiting for a long time, has no taste without chili, but after adding chili, there is only a little bit of spiciness left. My own trip can only be described as a bit regretful, but I am also visiting my old friend. Anyway, it is acceptable."

00087.wav,Chinese,"When I was a child, I was an extremely introverted child. In class, I always sat silently in the corner watching my classmates play and laugh, but I didn't dare to join in. I was afraid of being rejected and embarrassed, and this fear followed me like a shadow, causing me to miss many beautiful times. I remember once my class organized a speech competition, and watching my classmates confidently step onto the podium and give passionate speeches, my heart was filled with envy. I wish I could bravely stand in front of everyone like them and express my ideas. However, when the teacher asked me if I was willing to participate, I lowered my head and dared not answer. I was afraid that I would be too nervous to speak and afraid that my classmates would mock my timidity. This experience has made me even more disappointed with myself. I feel like a failure, but the turning point of fate often happens unintentionally, on a sunny afternoon. I accidentally came across a book about courage and growth in the library. The protagonist in the book gradually grew from a timid and afraid person to a brave and strong one. His story deeply moved me, and I began to reflect on myself. Why couldn't I face my fears bravely like him? I have decided to change myself. Since then, I have been actively communicating with my classmates. Although I was nervous at first, I forced myself to persevere. I participated in school club activities and tried to express my opinions in front of everyone.

When I was in high school, my family encountered a major upheaval. My father's business failed, and the family fell into financial difficulties. Watching my parents work hard for a living filled me with guilt and anxiety. I felt that I should take some responsibility for the family, so I began to use my spare time to work and earn money. Although those days were tough, they also taught me to be strong and independent. I understand the hardships of life and cherish every opportunity to learn even more. I study hard and hope to change the fate of my family through my own efforts. After the college entrance examination, I was admitted to an ideal university where I continued to work hard, actively participate in various social practice activities, and constantly improve my abilities. I also joined a volunteer team to teach in impoverished areas and help children in need. This experience has deeply impressed me with the joy and significance of helping others. Now that I have graduated from college and entered the workforce, looking back on the past, I am filled with emotions. The difficulties and setbacks of the past have now become precious treasures in my life. I am no longer the timid child, but a brave, strong, and confident person."

After touring the mountaintop, I happened to board an open cable car and descend halfway up the mountain, then take a bus back to the foot of the mountain. On the way to the bus, I also fell asleep unconsciously due to excessive fatigue."

My cousin's mother quickly started preparing dinner, and I saw him bring fresh vegetables from the small courtyard, which were green in color and full of vitality. The dinner was very sumptuous, with freshly cooked chicken soup, pickled vegetables, and freshly dug potatoes, especially sweet and fragrant. This meal reminded me of eating with my family when I was a child. The simple yet loving feeling seemed to take my heart back to the past. After dinner, my cousin and aunt took me to the village and the river to fish. We went fishing by the river in the village. We took bamboo poles and earthworms and walked for more than ten minutes along the field path to the small river outside the village. The river water was very clear, reflecting the blue sky and surrounding trees. The gentle breeze brushed over the water, causing ripples. I found a big stone to sit down and took the bait. Throw it into the river and wait quietly for the fish to bite. The river was very quiet, only the rustling sound of leaves being blown by the wind and the chirping of a few crickets could be heard. My cousin and I chatted about our recent situation sentence by sentence, talking about the days when we played hide and seek together as children. At that time, we were carefree and the whole world was like our amusement park. My cousin recalled the fun of us stealing grapes from our neighbor's house in those years, and he laughed heartily as he spoke. I couldn't help but laugh out loud, as if that beautiful time was right in front of us. As the night grew deeper, we didn't catch many fish, but it didn't matter. We sat under the starry sky, watching the twinkling stars and listening to the distant croaks of frogs, our hearts filled with tranquility. My cousin told me that although he lives in the countryside, he is very satisfied with this kind of life. He likes the freedom in the fields, the sense of security in working, and the warm interaction with his family and neighbors. I can feel the love for life and deep affection for his hometown in his words. That night, my cousin and I talked a lot and thought about it a lot. Although we live in different environments, the blood thicker than water bond between us has never changed. I deeply feel that although rural life does not have the bustling urban scenery, there is a kind of tranquility and warmth that cities cannot find. This visit has made me cherish this rare family bond even more, and has also made me realize that true happiness often comes from simple and authentic life."
