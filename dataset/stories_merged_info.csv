He was not in good health that year and lived in a small town hospital not far from the village. The winter wind was particularly biting, and I carried a bag of fruits that he liked to eat and walked into the hospital. When my grandmother saw me, a long lost smile appeared on her face. She said, 'How did you know that what I wanted the most was oranges?'? We talked a lot in the ward, and I asked him how his treatment was? But he always changes the topic and talks about recent events at home, such as the newly built house and the few fruit trees planted. I can see that he is trying hard to show strength, but I can also feel the exhaustion that cannot be hidden in his eyes. In the afternoon, I pushed his wheelchair to the garden behind the hospital. The winter sunshine was light, but it made people feel warm. Grandma quietly looked at the withered yellow leaves and suddenly asked me, do you think time passes too quickly? I didn't answer. Because I also have the same feeling. He began to tell stories from his youth, about how he carried my mother over a mountain to find a job, and how he managed to farm and support his family during the most difficult times. As I listened to these stories, I suddenly felt very guilty. I felt guilty that I always felt busy with work and didn't have time to come back to see him, but she never complained that I didn't come home often. When I left the hospital, I turned around and looked at her in the garden. The sunlight was shining on her white hair, and I thought to myself that no matter how busy I was in the future, I would come back to see her often because companionship was what she needed most.",0,0,2021年的冬天，我回了一趟老家探望外婆，那年他身体不好，住在离村子不远的小镇医院里，冬天的风特别刺骨，我拎着一袋儿他喜欢吃的水果走进了医院。外婆见到我时，脸上露出了久违的笑容，他说，你怎么知道我最想吃的就是橙子？我们在病房里聊了很多，我问他治疗的怎么样？他却总是岔开话题，说家里最近的事情，比如新盖的房子，种下的几棵果树，我能看出他在努力表现的很坚强，但也能感受到他眼中藏不住的疲惫。下午的时候，我推着他的轮椅到医院后面的花园，冬天的阳光很淡，却让人觉得温暖。外婆静静地看着那些枯黄的树叶，忽然开口问我，你是不是觉得时间过得太快了？我没回答。因为我也有同样的感受。他开始讲起年轻时候的故事，说他当年如何背着我母亲翻过一座山去找工作，又如何在最艰难的时候种田养家。我听着这些故事，心里忽然觉得很愧疚，愧疚于自己平时总觉得工作忙，没时间回来看他，而她却从未抱怨我不常回家。离开医院的时候，我回头看了看花园里的她阳光落在她的白发上，我心里想着以后无论多忙，我都要经常回来看她，因为陪伴才是他最需要的东西。,winter hometown visit grandmother good health year lived small town hospital village winter wind biting carried bag fruit eat walked hospital grandmother long lost smile appeared face wanted orange talked lot ward asked treatment topic talk event newly built house fruit tree planted hard strength feel exhaustion hidden eye afternoon pushed wheelchair garden hospital winter sunshine light people feel warm grandma quietly looked withered yellow leaf suddenly asked time pass didnt answer feeling began story youth carried mother mountain job managed farm support family difficult time listened story suddenly felt guilty felt guilty felt busy work didnt time complained didnt left hospital turned looked garden sunlight shining white hair thought matter busy future companionship needed

The beautiful scenery and unique culture of Yunnan have always been my dream, and this trip has deeply impressed me with its charm. The most unforgettable day for me was riding by the Erhai Lake. The feeling of freedom and tranquility is still unforgettable to this day. In the early morning, I rented a bicycle from Dali Old City and rode along the lakeside path of Erhai Lake. The water of Erhai Lake was as calm as a mirror in the early morning, reflecting the surrounding green mountains and the white clouds in the sky. The breeze gently blew, the lake began to ripple, and the sun shone on the water. The whole picture seemed to come out of the painting. I take photos while riding my bike, occasionally stopping to appreciate the beautiful scenery in front of me. Along the way, I met many tourists who rode the same bike, some from the south and some from abroad. Everyone was impressed by the peaceful beauty of Erhai Lake. At noon, I stopped at a small restaurant by the lake and tasted authentic Yunnan cuisine, especially the local roasted milk fan. It was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, with a strong milk aroma that left an unforgettable taste. In the afternoon, I continued cycling and enjoyed different angles of Erhai Lake along the way. In some places, I could see fishing boats slowly gliding over the lake, while in others, I was surrounded by rice paddies and small mountain villages. Every scenery was unforgettable. In the evening, I sat down at the observation deck by the Erhai Lake. The sunset dyed the entire lake red, and the scene of fishing boats returning home was quiet and beautiful. I felt an unprecedented sense of tranquility and satisfaction.

My journey begins with the famous Forbidden City, which is the largest and most well preserved imperial palace complex in the world. When I stepped into the huge red palace gate, it was as if I had traveled through history. The exquisite carvings, magnificent roofs, and vast courtyards showcased the grandeur of the Ming and Qing dynasties. When visiting the Hall of Supreme Harmony and the Imperial Garden, I was fascinated by the architectural craftsmanship and rich history here. Then I went to the Bathing Field section of the Great Wall, which is not far from the city center. This section of the Great Wall is famous for its magnificent scenery and fewer tourists. Although the climbing process was arduous, standing at the top and gazing at the stretching mountains and the long Great Wall, all exhaustion vanished into thin air. Standing on this ancient defense project, I felt a shock that lasted for thousands of years. Returning to the city center, I visited Tiananmen Square, which is one of the largest squares in the world. The magnificent scale of the square is breathtaking, and I spent some time contemplating its cultural and historical significance. Not far away, I also attended and visited the Temple of Heaven, a masterpiece of Ming Dynasty architecture. The circular Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests is both magnificent and symbolizes the concept of unity between heaven and man. The cuisine in Beijing is equally impressive. I tasted the famous Beijing roast duck, a delicacy that has been passed down for a hundred years and left a lasting impression on me. The chef skillfully sliced it, and the crispy duck skin and tender duck meat paired it with pancakes and sweet sauce, making it a feast for the taste buds. At night, I strolled through the bustling alleys, which showcased the traditional side of Beijing. The snack stalls and specialty shops on the streets of Xiaoyuanzi made me feel the authentic and leisurely life of the locals.

Then I took the bus to see the American scenery along the bus. I saw a Starbucks in the United States and a Gothic style building in the car, and I even took photos to commemorate it. Afterwards, my classmates and I came to Columbia University for a tour. The university square is very spacious, with sunlight shining on the lawn, which is very pleasing to the eye. It was winter at the time, so we walked around Columbia University wearing down jackets. I saw the unique buildings of different colleges, including the Philosophy and Law schools. I also saw pigeons walking on the ground, which was a very harmonious and beautiful scene. The statue of Athena, the goddess of wisdom at Columbia University, is very dignified and solemn. After the visit to the university, my classmates, teachers, and I took a group photo in front of this statue as a memento. Afterwards, we took a bus to Wall Street and I touched the famous golden bull statue. I heard that touching its horns can bring me wealth, which is also a beautiful symbolism. I also took a photo in front of this golden bull statue as a souvenir. Afterwards, I took a cruise with my team to observe the Statue of Liberty.

As I stepped onto this ancient land, my heart was filled with anticipation and awe. My first stop on my trip to Shaanxi was Xi'an, a thousand year old ancient capital that seems to narrate the vicissitudes of history. Walking on the walls of the ancient city, I feel like I can hear the echoes of history, and every brick and stone carries the weight of history. Walking into the Terra Cotta Warriors Museum, I felt the hegemony and glory of Qin Shihuang's unification of the six countries with the rows of lifelike terracotta warriors. Then I arrived at Tsinghua Palace, which was once a witness to the love between Emperor Xuanzong of Tang and Yang Guifei. Walking by the hot springs, I felt as if I could see the scene of them playing here back then and feel the romance that spans thousands of years. Of course, Shaanxi cuisine is also not to be missed. A bowl of hot Pita bread soaked in Lamb Soup let me taste the local authentic flavor. The rich soup, fresh mutton, and crispy modules make me have endless aftertaste. This trip to Shaanxi made me deeply feel the breadth and depth of Chinese civilization. From the ancient city walls to the spectacular Terra Cotta Warriors, from the romantic Qinghua Palace to the delicious Pita bread soaked in Lamb Soup, every place in the United States of Shaanxi makes me linger. In this land of Shanxi, not only did I appreciate the weight of history, but I also felt the charm of Chinese culture.

This trip was very special for me because Hangzhou is a place I've always wanted to go to but haven't. And this friend from Hangzhou is my high school classmate. Since we started college, we have been busy on our own and haven't seen each other again. That morning, as I sat outside the high-speed train window in Hangzhou, the scenery gradually changed from a bustling city to lush mountains and clear waters. Along the way, I was full of anticipation. When I arrived in Hangzhou, my friend picked me up at the station. At the moment we met, we both smiled, as if we were back in high school. He took me to the old street he recommended, which is a very quiet pedestrian street lined with old houses and small shops. He said it preserves his memories of two years in college and is one of his favorite places. Let's first make the sweet and fragrant osmanthus lotus root powder of Heliwan hot on the street, and then feel the warmth of home. I slowly walked on the old street and looked at the small stalls selling handicrafts. My friend told me a story about what happened during his two years of college here. He said he didn't always come when he was sad or happy. This pedestrian street is for relaxing and leisure activities. I looked at his smile as if I could see what he looked like on this street at the time. In the afternoon, we went to West Lake, and the willows by the lake had already turned slightly yellow. The lake was shimmering with golden light in the sunlight. We rented a small boat and slid slowly to the center of the lake, where the wind was light and cool. It seemed like we had talked a lot about his college life and hobbies, as well as his plans for the future. We also talked about the days in high school when we stayed up late together and went out to play with our backs. Time passed quickly, as the sunset gradually set and the lake was dyed orange red. That night, we had dinner at a small restaurant by the lake. Although it was just a home cooked meal, it was particularly delicious with the company of old friends. After dinner, we took a walk by the lake, watching the distant lights reflecting on the surface of the lake, like countless stars scattered in the water. I took a deep breath and felt that the tranquility and beauty of this moment would forever remain in my memory.",0,6,去年秋天在国庆假期期间我去了杭州，采访了一个多年未见的朋友，这次旅程对我来说非常特别，因为杭州是我一直想去还没有去去的地方。而这位杭州而这位朋友是我的高中同学，我们自从上大学后就各自忙碌，再也没有见面。那天我一早坐上去杭州的高铁车窗外的景色从繁华的城市逐渐变成青山绿水，一路上我充满期待，到达杭州后朋友在车站接我，我们见面的那一刻彼此都笑了，仿佛回到了高中时光。他带我去了他推荐的那条老街，那是一条非常安静的步行街，两旁是老旧的房屋和小商铺，他说这里保留了他在大学时期两年的记忆，是他最喜欢的地方之一。我们在街边首先做一下和力丸热乎乎的桂花藕粉那种淡淡的甜味和桂花的香气，然后感受到一种家的温暖。我慢慢走在老街上看着那些卖手工艺品的小摊，朋友给我讲述了他在这里两年大学之际发生的故事，他说他没当难过时或有什么开心的事情都会来。这条步行街散心游玩。我看着他的笑容仿佛也看到了他当时在这条街的样子，下午的时候我们去了西湖，湖边的柳树已经微微泛黄，湖水在阳光下闪烁着金色的光芒，我们租了一只小船慢悠悠地滑到湖心，湖面上风很轻，带着淡淡的凉意，好像和我聊了很多关于他的大学生活和兴趣爱好，还有他对未来的打算。我们也聊起了高中时点点滴滴那些我们一起熬夜背着一起出去玩的日子时间过得很快，夕阳渐渐西沉，湖面上被染上一片橙红色。那天晚上我们在湖边的小饭馆吃了一顿晚餐，虽然只是一顿家常菜，但因为有老朋友的陪伴显得格外美味。饭后我们散步在湖边，看着远处的灯火，倒映在湖面上，像是无数的星星洒落在水中，我深吸一口气，感觉这一刻的宁静和美好将永远留在我记忆中。,autumn national day holiday hangzhou interview friend hadnt year trip special hangzhou place ive wanted havent friend hangzhou high school classmate started college busy havent morning sat highspeed train window hangzhou scenery gradually changed bustling city lush mountain clear water anticipation arrived hangzhou friend picked station moment met smiled high school street recommended quiet pedestrian street lined house small shop preserve memory year college favorite place sweet fragrant osmanthus lotus root powder heliwan hot street feel warmth slowly walked street looked small stall selling handicraft friend told story happened year college didnt sad happy pedestrian street relaxing leisure activity looked smile looked street time afternoon west lake willow lake turned yellow lake shimmering golden light sunlight rented small boat slid slowly center lake wind light cool talked lot college life hobby plan future talked day high school stayed late play back time passed sunset gradually set lake dyed orange red night dinner small restaurant lake cooked meal delicious company friend dinner walk lake watching distant light reflecting surface lake countless star scattered water deep breath felt tranquility beauty moment remain memory

Friends who have been playing like this since childhood are called hairdressers. Ah, this feeling is very wonderful. Hmm, it's like looking at each other since childhood, watching each other grow up together. And this photo on the wall still captures countless happy moments we had back then. Um, then I saw Xiaoyu walking out of his bedroom. We smiled at each other, and for some reason, our past happiness surged in our hearts, but at the same time, there was also a hint of melancholy mixed in. We have indeed grown up and can't go back. Well, things are no longer that simple now. We sat on the balcony chatting about childhood anecdotes. He mentioned that we used to catch fish by the small river together, and the sound of cicadas echoed in the summer afternoon. I couldn't help but laugh out loud, but at that moment, I felt a little sad again. Time had passed, and we could never go back to that carefree age. We now had our own studies and had to work hard for our own things. Well, the people and things we come into contact with now are also different, and I feel that there may be a sad and thick barrier between us. I think it's a sad thing, but there's nothing we can do about it. As I bid farewell, I suddenly felt a complex emotion in my heart, both the joy of reunion and the nostalgia for the past.

I embarked on this journey with a few friends, and when we first arrived in this city, we were deeply impressed by the scenery before us. The streets of Venice are not traditional streets, but winding waterways that recreate the ancient architecture surrounding them, like a scroll into history. We eagerly boarded the traditional Venetian small boat, the Gondola, and slowly sailed through the waterway. The boatman skillfully slid his feet, leading us through the complex of buildings with a strong sense of history. The sunset reflected on the water, adding a few golden rays to the surrounding scenery. The entire city appeared peaceful and mysterious. In addition to the tour of Dogongdora, we also visited St. Mark's Square, which is one of the most famous squares in Venice. The square was bustling with people, and flocks of pigeons flew in the air, occasionally landing on the ground, attracting tourists to feed them. Surrounding the square are magnificent buildings, with the golden dome of St. Mark's Church shining brightly in the sunlight. At the Church of Santa Maria del Fiore, on the other side and in the square, we met an artist who painted portraits of tourists. I asked him to paint a portrait for me, and the artist smiled and gently touched me, beginning to depict it in detail. Painting is filled with the aroma of coffee and melodious music. I am quietly waiting, and after painting, the artist hands me the portrait. The me in the painting looks more vivid and interesting than the real me. This encounter left a deep impression on me.

Xiaojuan was my best friend during my college years, and we spent many wonderful times together. At that time, we often stayed up late together to review, discuss our life ideals, and dream of exploring the world together after graduation. However, after graduation, we embarked on different paths and gradually lost touch. Every time I think of him, I feel a bit regretful, but we all know that life always takes people further and further away. Until one day, I received a message from his family that Xiaojuan was seriously ill and in a very bad condition. Upon hearing this news, my heart was filled with helplessness and anxiety, and I decided to go see him as soon as possible. When I arrived at Xiaojun's house, I saw him lying on the hospital bed, so thin that I could hardly recognize him. Although he forced a smile, there was a deep exhaustion in his eyes. We sat in front of his hospital bed, chatting about the time we spent together before. He gently said that he had been waiting for me to come and see him because he knew I wouldn't leave him behind. Nike, I feel like there's a stone pressing down on my heart, unable to breathe. Xiao Jun handed me a notebook and said it was written by him during this period, which recorded his memories of the past, our friendship, and his helplessness towards the future. He said that if one day he left on his own, he hoped that I could remember him and also remember the beauty of the past. Upon hearing these words, I could hardly control my tears, but I could only try my best to appear strong and whisper that you would definitely get better. That night, we sat side by side in the yard, listening to the distant bell and wind. The air was a bit cold, but he still didn't want me to leave and held me back. I promised him that I wouldn't come back to see him again next time. However, when we said goodbye, I had no chance to say those words to him that you must be in such a miserable situation again. A few months later, Xiaozhen passed away. When I received the news, my heart was empty, as if I had lost a friend who could never be added back. I opened the notebook he left for me and read those words, as if everything was so real and yet so distant with him by my side. Every time I see those agreements about him, my heart surges with pain.

But by the beach, I heard the real sound of waves for the first time. The sound was both majestic and gentle, like a symphony of nature. My friends cheered while rushing towards the sea, and I rolled up my pants and cautiously walked in. The cool sea water soaked my ankles, and the waves lightly hit my skin, bringing an indescribable joy and novelty. We also rented a small boat to go out to sea, and the captain told us that dolphins can often be seen near the sea.

Well, in this year's group stage, the German team lost their first game to the very strong Spanish team in the same group, which cast a shadow on the fans of the German team and their psychology. However, in the following two matches, Germany, Lynk&Co, Japan, and Belgium successfully advanced to the next round as the second place team in the group. In the knockout stage of the quarter finals, the German team faced another group, the first Argentina, in their second group. The German team ultimately ended the game with a score of 4-0. Well, this score is undoubtedly a lot played. The fans who are not optimistic about the face of the German team, because the German team advanced to the quarter finals with a very beautiful victory. Then, in the quarterfinals, they went cold and defeated the favorite Brazilian team 2-1, successfully advancing to the quarterfinals. They also defeated the group stage team, which they had previously lost to, and the Spanish team, which they had previously lost to in the group stage. Eventually, they advanced to the finals, which made many people think that the German team was a dark horse in this World Cup. However, I believe that the German team only showed their normal strength. In the final, the German team faced the former World Cup champion Italy, but their skills have also declined in recent years. Faced with the fierce attack of the German team, the Italian team ultimately lost the game 0-3. The German team finally lifted the long-awaited trophy and won the World Cup.

I stood on the roadside feeling a bit flustered and didn't know what to do. Just as I was feeling anxious, a middle-aged man walked up to me. He looked very friendly, wearing simple clothes and smiling. Seeing that I was a bit confused, he took the initiative to ask if I needed help. Seeing his smile, I felt a sense of peace of mind. So I told him that I was lost, my phone was out of battery, and I couldn't find my way back to the hotel. He smiled and said, 'No problem, come with me.'. This stranger didn't hesitate at all and decided to help me. He took me to a nearby caf é, charged me, and used simple gestures and English to tell me how to take the subway back to the hotel. He even sat down with me to chat and buy me a cup of coffee. Although we didn't speak the same language, we successfully established communication through body language and smiles. At this moment, I feel like I am no longer a lonely tourist, but rather receiving warm care from others. Through this experience, I deeply understand that kindness between people transcends culture and language. Sometimes a stranger's smile and kindness can make us feel incredibly warm and grounded.

Ah, when I went there, I found that it really felt very different. The buildings in Shanghai are particularly tall and densely packed, taller than those in Beijing. Well, I feel like the people there give me a trendy and modern vibe. And there I also met a friend who was slightly older than me, a woman. She told me that she was a woman who had a relationship with fashion and fashion magazines. She worked there, and he was probably in his twenties, almost 30 years older than me. Well, we met at that clothing store, and then he saw my bag because it was my little decoration. He thought it was great, and we started chatting. That day, he also took me to a bar in Shanghai, where I met many of his friends. They are all very trendy and fashionable people. Uh huh. Right there, he treated me to a few drinks, and I really felt happy because it made me feel a very free and diverse culture in Shanghai. Uh huh. But we didn't leave any contact information afterwards, that's all. That afternoon and evening, after finishing my drink, I said goodbye to him and started my solo journey again. Well, I went there for two or three days, about three days, including my transportation time. However, I feel that the prices in Shanghai are very expensive.

The scenery along the way was intertwined and varied, with trees, railways, grasslands, and occasionally a few small rivers. We talked and laughed along the way, so the journey was not particularly boring. The first thing we did when we arrived in Jilin Province was to taste the local iron pot stew. Although iron pot stew is more enjoyable to eat in winter, we still had to take a bite even after going there. In the summer, we were sweating profusely due to the stuffiness. The carefully prepared sauce and various side dishes were boiled and wrapped in a large pancake, and we still couldn't stop thinking about the rice. Later, we went to Changbai Mountain again because the cool weather there allowed us to briefly escape from Beijing's steam ovens. The scenery was beautiful, with lush forests and fresh air. We wandered between clouds and mist, feeling like we were in a fairyland. Then there were a few eagles hovering and flying over the mountain spring on the side, as if they had received a hug from nature. Afterwards, we went to Northeast barbecue, where grilled skewers were a major specialty. It is said that there are no Northeasterners who can't barbecue skewers. The meat and dishes are very sincere, and the fire control is just right. Unlike the thin and hard skewers made by street vendors, the skewers we ate can be described as fresh, fragrant, and delicious, with alternating fat and thin, steaming hot, and making a slight sizzling sound. I still drool when I think about it now. Then we also tried several local specialty dishes, such as the Three Fresh Pot Pork and the Slippery Pork Section. Although these dishes can be found in takeout from various places, we can only taste the most authentic flavor in Northeast China. When stir fried on the table, you can still bring out enamel coated pork belly, which looks like a dark plate of ground three fresh dishes. However, each dish is coated with a sauce that has been thickened, making it a perfect complement to the meal. The prices of the dishes there are relatively cheap, and there is no shortage of food. The bosses are very enthusiastic, and during the waiting period, they even give us homemade pickled vegetables or appetizers, and chat with us about our daily lives. In our communication with the boss, even our accents have become a bit Northeastern, indicating that Northeastern has a greater impact on people's accents. This trip was a journey of playfulness and relaxation while standing on Changbai Mountain, as well as the ultimate enjoyment brought by authentic Northeastern cuisine. It can be considered a journey of enjoyment or healing.",1,37,嗯我和几个同学在2017年的夏天自驾去了长白山，走的是公路，所以路途比较长，沿途的风景交错变化，有树、铁路、草地，时不时还能看到几条小河，一路上有说有笑，所以车程不算特别无聊。抵达吉林省我们第一件事就是品去品尝当地的铁锅炖，虽然铁锅炖冬天吃更有感觉，但去都去了，夏天闷得满头是汗也得尝一口，那里精心搭配好的酱汁，将各种配菜都煮烂包裹在一个大面饼里，就着米饭现在想想都还意犹未尽。随后我们又去了长白山，因为那里比较凉爽的天气让我们短暂逃离了北京的蒸炉，景色很优美，郁郁葱葱的树林里面，而且空气很清新，穿梭在云雾之间，感觉像在仙境里一样。然后侧面还有山泉留下几只鹰盘旋飞过，在那里仿仿佛接受了来自大自然的拥抱。之后我们去吃了东北烧烤，那里的烤串是一大特色，据说东北人是没有不会烤串的，然后肉量和菜品都特别实诚，火火候掌握的刚刚好，不像那些地摊小贩儿做的又瘦又硬的肉串儿，我们吃到的串儿都可以用鲜香肥美来形容，就肥瘦相间，冒着热气，然后还能发出点滋啦滋啦的声音。现在想想还是会流口水。然后我们还尝了几大当地的特色菜肴，比如说地三鲜锅包肉，还有溜肉段，这些菜虽然各地外卖都能吃得到，但真正到了东北咱们才能吃到最正宗的味道。现炒上桌还能拿出搪瓷的锅包肉，然后看起来黑乎乎一盘的地三鲜，但其中每一个菜块都沾上了勾好芡的酱汁，然后又是一个下饭绝配。那里的嗯菜品价格比较便宜，而且绝不缺斤少两，老板都特别热情，在等菜期间还会给我们送自家腌制的小菜啊或者是开胃的凉拌菜，也和我们唠了唠家常。在与老板的沟通交流中，连我们说话的口音都变得有点东北味，还是东北对人对人口音的影响大。这次旅行有旅途上小打小闹，又站在长白山上时的心旷神怡，还有地道东北菜带来的极致享受，算是一个享受或者治愈的旅途吧。,classmate drove changbai mountain road summer journey long scenery intertwined varied tree railway grassland occasionally small river talked laughed journey boring arrived jilin province taste local iron pot stew iron pot stew enjoyable eat winter bite summer sweating profusely stuffiness carefully prepared sauce dish boiled wrapped large pancake thinking rice changbai mountain cool weather allowed escape beijing steam oven scenery beautiful lush forest fresh air wandered cloud mist feeling fairyland eagle hovering flying mountain spring received hug nature northeast barbecue grilled skewer major specialty northeasterners barbecue skewer meat dish control hard skewer street vendor skewer ate fresh fragrant delicious alternating fat steaming hot making slight sizzling sound drool local specialty dish fresh pot pork slippery pork dish takeout place taste authentic flavor northeast china stir fried table bring enamel coated pork belly dark plate ground fresh dish dish coated sauce thickened making perfect complement meal price dish cheap shortage food boss enthusiastic waiting period homemade pickled vegetable appetizer chat daily life communication bos accent bit northeastern indicating northeastern greater impact people accent trip journey playfulness relaxation standing changbai mountain ultimate enjoyment brought authentic northeastern cuisine considered journey enjoyment healing

Well, what's different about this trip is that in the past, Beijing wasn't considered my hometown because I had to take the high-speed train every time to get here. But this time, what's different is that I'm studying here, so I don't need to take the high-speed train. We played for about a week. At first, we planned to join a group tour, but after thinking about it, we decided to choose a customized tour called Ctrip because we took care of many elderly people and children in the team. I remember it cost several tens of thousands of yuan to charter a car, which was quite expensive. However, the experience was not that good because some bad things happened during the group tour. For example, due to some traffic restrictions and vehicles, the car we booked couldn't arrive at our place in time. Also, the driver may have been a bit lazy and didn't want to pick us up. So although he gave him money, he didn't give it to us. We worked diligently, and in the end, Ctrip also provided us with some compensation. Well, you're asking me if I'm happy driving, right? Well, it's just so so, because although he compensated me, I still felt a little weak. Finally, we went to many places, including Peking University, the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, and many other places. Then I found that many places were not very good at grabbing tickets. I had to work hard to grab tickets. The place that impressed me most was Universal Studios. Well, Universal Studios was very interesting. There were many unique movie characters of Zhan Huan, and some other things in it. It was very interesting. Uh huh. Um, I remember on the last day, we went to the Forbidden City. Actually, I didn't think it was suitable to go there on the last day, but it was still the last day because you know it's difficult to grab tickets. So on the last day when I went to the Forbidden City, I remember there were still people wearing the emperor's clothes going in to take photos. I think this idea is quite novel. Uh huh. Overall, it was a pretty good trip, but there were also some bad things. Because you know Ctrip's drivers are a bit lazy, so this is my story.",0,38,嗯我记得在2023年的夏天，我邀请嗯然后嗯我和我的家人一起来北京玩，因为我在北京邮电大学上学。嗯这次旅游和以往不同的是，以前嗯北京对我来说不算是一个故乡，因为我每次得坐高铁才能到这里来，但这一次嗯不一样的是我就在这上学，所以我不需要坐高铁。我们大概玩了有一个星期左右的时间，嗯当初一开始准备的是跟团游，但是后来我们想了一下，因为照顾到团队里就是很多老人跟小孩，所以最后我们决定是选择一个叫携程的定制游，就是包车我记得当时一共花了差不多有几好几万块，感觉还是挺贵的，但是体验的话其实也没有那么好，因为跟团游当时发生了一些不太好的事情，比如说因为嗯一些交通的管制呀车辆，我们当时包的车不能及时的到达我们这里，还有就是嗯司机可能有点偷懒，不想来接我们，所以虽然给他钱了，但他没有给我们认真工作，最后呢携程也给我们一些补偿。嗯那你要问我开不开心吧？嗯其实一般般，因为虽虽然他给我补偿了，但是感觉还是有点亏，最后我们也去了不少地方，嗯来了北京人大学，还有一些长城呀，故宫呀，还有很多其他的地方，然后我发现这个很多地方其实都不是很好抢票，抢票的话都要拼手速，印象最深的地方应该是环球影城，嗯环球影城还是挺好玩的，里面有很独詹欢的电影角色，嗯小黄人还有一些其他的东西，感觉还是挺好玩的。嗯嗯。呃嗯我记得最后一天的话，我们去的那个是故宫，其实觉得最后一天去故宫其实不太合适，但是还是最后一天去了，因为因为你知道抢票很难。嗯所以最后一天去故宫的时候，我记得当时好像还有人穿皇帝的衣服进去拍照，我觉得这个这个想法还挺新奇的。嗯嗯。嗯总的来说这是一次还不错的旅行，但是也有一些不太好的事情吧。因为你知道携程他那边司机有点懒，所以这就是我的故事。,remember summer invited family play beijing studying beijing university post telecommunication trip beijing wasnt considered hometown highspeed train time time studying dont highspeed train played week planned join group tour thinking decided choose customized tour called ctrip care elderly people child team remember cost ten thousand yuan charter car expensive experience good bad happened group tour traffic restriction vehicle car booked arrive place time driver bit lazy didnt pick money didnt worked diligently ctrip compensation happy driving compensated felt weak finally place including peking university great wall forbidden city place place good grabbing ticket work hard grab ticket place impressed universal studio universal studio interesting unique movie character zhan huan interesting uh huh um remember day forbidden city didnt suitable day day difficult grab ticket day forbidden city remember people wearing emperor clothes photo idea uh huh pretty good trip bad ctrips driver bit lazy story

Ah, I finally went to the United States to participate in an NBA game in person. Not only that, but I also got a chance to meet basketball superstar LeBron James. It all sounded like a dream, but when I stood in front of the Staples Center in Los Angeles, I couldn't believe my eyes. I have always been a loyal fan of James. Since the season he first entered the league, I have been following his games and witnessing his glorious journey from Cleveland to Miami, back to Cleveland, and finally joining the Los Angeles Lakers to win multiple championships. Being able to see him with my own eyes and even communicate with him face-to-face is an unparalleled honor for me. I arrived at the game venue early that day, and the atmosphere was filled with excitement and tension. The Lakers were about to face the Warriors, and fans gathered outside the door excitedly discussing game predictions and player performances. Finally, the staff took me into an area specially prepared for the media and VIP guests, where I could observe the team's preparation process up close. As I walked into the hallway of the players' locker room, I suddenly heard heavy footsteps. I turned around and saw the basketball superstar LeBron James, whom I had admired since childhood. He was wearing a Lakers training uniform and holding a bottle of water in his hand, walking towards the training ground. Although he looked very focused, when he saw me, he smiled slightly and seemed to be familiar with me. We started discussing basketball and also talked about his personal life. He told me that besides the challenges of the basketball court, family and social responsibility are the most important parts of his life. He mentioned that as an athlete, he sometimes faces tremendous pressure, but he always believes that with the support and unremitting efforts of the team, all difficulties can be overcome. I asked him, during your long career, when did you feel the most proud? James and Chen Slupanik smiled slightly and answered, 'My greatest pride is being able to bring back that championship trophy for my hometown Cleveland. It was the result of our team's hard work and the most unforgettable moment of my career.'. Winning the championship is not just for myself, but for the fans and people in my hometown who have always supported me. In just a short conversation, James left a deep impression on me. His humility and focus, as well as his love for basketball, far exceeded what I knew of him. He is not only a superstar on the court, but also full of water management and human touch off the court. When I said goodbye to her, I felt an indescribable sense of satisfaction. Being able to communicate face-to-face with great athletes like James was one of the most precious experiences of my life. Although I know that people like James may only meet once in their lives, his focused and passionate spirit will always inspire me to constantly pursue my dreams. The game began, and I sat on the sidelines, my eyes fixed on every moment on the ball. James' performance on the court was as stunning as usual, and in that moment off the court, his sincerity and humility deeply touched me. That's all thank you。",1,41,啊那是一个充满期待的日子。啊我终于亲自去到了美国参加了一场NBA的比赛，不仅如此，我还获得了一个与篮球巨星勒布朗詹姆斯见面的机会，这一切听起来像是一个梦境，但是当我站在洛杉矶的斯台普斯中心门前时，我几乎不敢相信自己的眼睛。我一直是詹姆斯的忠实粉丝，从他刚进联盟的那个赛季开始，我就一直关注着他的比赛，见证了他从克利夫兰到迈阿密，再到回到克利夫兰，再到最终加入洛杉矶湖人获得多个总冠军的辉煌历程，能够亲眼见到他，甚至与他面对面交流，对我来说简直是无与伦比的荣耀。那天我早早的来到比赛场地，空气中弥漫着兴奋与紧张的气氛，湖人队将对阵勇士，球迷们聚集在门外外面，兴奋的讨论着比赛的预测和球员的表现，终于工作人员带我进入了专门为媒体和VIP嘉宾准备的区域，这里可以近距离观察到球队的准备过程。当我走进球员更衣室的走廊时，突然听到了一阵沉重的脚步声，我转身眼前就出现了那位从小就崇拜的篮球巨星勒布朗詹姆斯，他穿着湖人队的训练服，手上拿着一瓶水正走向训练场地，虽然他看起来非常专注，但当他看到我时微微一笑，似乎对我并不陌生，我们开始讨论篮球，也聊到了他个人的生活，他告诉我除了篮球场的挑战，家庭和社会责任是他人生中最重要的部分。他提到作为一名运动员，他有时也会面临巨大压力，但他始终相信通过团队的支持和不懈努力，一切困难都能够克服。我问他，在你漫长的职业生涯中，什么时候让你觉得最为骄傲？詹姆斯、陈斯鲁潘尼克微微笑着回答，我最大的骄傲就是能够为我的家乡克利夫兰带回那个总冠军广杯，那是我们团队奋斗的结果，也是我职业生涯中最难忘的一刻。赢得总冠军不只是为了我自己，而是为了那些一直支持我的球迷和家乡的人。在短短的交流中，詹姆斯就给我留下了深刻的印象，他的谦逊专注，他对篮球的热爱远远超出了我对他的认识，他不仅是场上的超级巨星，场下的他也充满治水和人情味。当我与她告别时，我感到一种难以言喻的满足感，能够与詹姆斯这样的伟大运动员面对面交流，是我人生中最宝贵的经历之一。尽管我知道像詹姆斯这样的人物可能一生只有那么一次偶遇，但他那份专注和热情的精神将永远激励我不断追求自己的梦想。比赛开始了，我坐在场边，眼睛紧紧盯着球上的每一刻，詹姆斯在场上表现如同平常一样令人惊叹，而在场外的那一刻，他的真诚和谦逊也深深的触动了我。That's all thank you。,day anticipation finally united participate nba game person chance meet basketball superstar lebron james sounded dream stood staple center los angeles eye loyal fan james season entered league game witnessing glorious journey cleveland miami cleveland finally joining los angeles lakers win multiple championship eye communicate facetoface unparalleled honor arrived game venue early day atmosphere filled excitement tension lakers face warrior fan gathered door excitedly discussing game prediction player performance finally staff area specially prepared medium vip guest observe team preparation process close walked hallway player locker room suddenly heard heavy footstep turned basketball superstar lebron james admired childhood wearing lakers training uniform holding bottle water hand walking training ground looked focused smiled familiar started discussing basketball talked personal life told challenge basketball court family social responsibility part life mentioned athlete face tremendous pressure belief support unremitting effort team difficulty overcome asked long career feel james chen slupanik smiled answered greatest pride bring championship trophy hometown cleveland result team hard work unforgettable moment career winning championship fan people hometown supported short conversation james left deep impression humility focus love basketball exceeded knew superstar court water management human touch court goodbye felt indescribable sense satisfaction communicate facetoface great athlete james precious experience life people james meet life focused passionate spirit inspire constantly pursue dream game began sat sideline eye fixed moment ball james performance court stunning usual moment court sincerity humility deeply touched

Because Hangzhou is known for its beautiful scenery and rich culture of West Lake, after arriving there, we first went to the particularly famous West Lake scenic spot, where the weather is clear, the sunshine shines on the lake surface, and the lake water is sparkling, especially beautiful. We walked slowly along the trail by the lake, feeling the fresh air and leisurely atmosphere. The willow trees by the lake sway in the wind, as if beckoning to us, and the chirping of birds can be heard around. The entire environment is very peaceful. My friend and I talked a lot by the lake, talking about the changes in our lives over the years, and we felt very close. Then we also took a boat tour of West Lake, and the boat slowly moved forward on the surface of the lake. The distant Leifeng Pagoda gradually came into view, beautiful and moving like an ancient painting. At that moment, I really felt very relaxed, as if all my troubles had disappeared. After visiting the West Lake, my friend took me to taste Dongpo Braised Pork, a special food in Hangzhou. We ordered this dish in a time-honored restaurant. Dongpo Braised Pork melts in the mouth, is fat but not greasy, and tastes really delicious. My friend also told me the story behind this dish, which is said to have been created by Su Dongpo back then. It's really interesting. After dinner, we went to a tea house again. Longjing tea from Hangzhou is particularly famous. We ordered a few cups and sat in the tea house to savor it slowly. We watched the night view gradually descend outside the window, and the lights on the lake flickered, reflecting a peaceful scenery. That feeling was very warm and made me have a deeper love for Hangzhou. This trip not only allowed me to appreciate the beautiful scenery of Hangzhou, but also allowed me to have more communication with my friends, bringing us closer together. After returning home, I couldn't forget that wonderful time.

Every time I step out of the classroom, the piercing chill pierces my skin like a merciless blade, making it impossible to breathe. Even though it was so cold outside, the sunlight still mischievously streamed through the window into the classroom, quietly covering the desks. The light was gentle and brilliant, as if it were a warm friend, gently caressing our hearts in the cold winter, bringing a hint of tranquility and comfort. Throughout the morning, we buried ourselves shoulder to shoulder in our textbooks and homework, reading at lightning speed in our notebooks, as if time had slipped away quietly without us noticing. The cold winter outside the window is quietly brewing a surprise. In our world, there are only knowledge points on the blackboard and intense review, and there is no other space in our hearts. At that time, we didn't know that the beautiful times of life always came unintentionally. In the afternoon, the setting sun gradually tilted westward, the sky gradually dimmed and became hazy, and the sky seemed to be foreshadowing what was about to happen. Suddenly, snowflakes danced freely, and the first snowflakes fell slowly like light feathers, seemingly the gentlest blessing in the sky. Gradually, the snowflakes became denser and denser, as if countless little elves were dancing joyfully in the sky, dancing and spinning with the wind melody, gently falling to the ground. Each snowflake was a line of poetry from nature, and its implementation was a touch of tenderness in winter. I couldn't help but put down my pen and gaze at the snow scenery outside the window. At that moment, my heart suddenly became unusually peaceful, and all the study pressure and homework troubles disappeared in this moment. Through the glass, I seem to be able to smell the fragrance of snowflakes, a scent that thoroughly purifies the soul. Snowflakes silently covered everything and washed away my inner restlessness, making me feel a long lost sense of ease and joy. As the snow grew heavier and heavier, the trees, playground, and even the eaves of the campus were covered with a thin layer of white snow. The whole world seemed to be draped in a soft and quiet white veil, and the air was filled with the scent of snow. Everything became particularly clear and peaceful. At that moment, I couldn't help but fantasize that after class, I would run freely on the grass, stepping on the soft snow and making a creaking sound. That carefree joy dispelled all the gloom in my heart like sunshine. We are like a group of children who have lost their bonds, immersed in this snow-white world, until the sky darkens. Recalling those fluttering snowflakes, I can still feel the ease and joy of letting go of all worries. That day was like washing away the dust from my heart, bringing endless joy and warmth. The beauty in life often quietly descends upon us unintentionally.",0,50,那是初三的一个冬天，寒风肆意的在窗外怒号，仿佛整个世界都被冻成了冰冷的模样。每当我踏出教室，刺骨的寒意就像无情的利刃刺入肌肤，让人无法呼吸。即使外面是那样的寒冷，阳光依然顽皮地透过窗户洒进教室，静静地铺满了课桌，光线温柔而灿烂，仿佛是一位温暖的朋友，在寒冷冬日里轻轻抚摸着我们的内心，带来一丝丝宁静与安慰。整上午我们埋头在课本与作业中比肩，在作业本上飞速阅读，仿佛时间也随之悄悄溜走，我们完全没有察觉。窗外那寒冷的冬日正悄悄酝酿着一场惊喜，在我们的世界里只有黑板上的知识点和紧张的复习，而心中已然没有了其他空间。那时我们不知道生活的美好时光总是在不经意间降临，到了下午，斜阳渐渐西斜，天色逐渐暗淡灰蒙蒙，天幕仿佛也在即将而为即将发生的事做着预示。突然雪花四溢的飞舞，最初那些雪花如轻盈般的羽毛缓缓下落，似乎是天空中最温柔的祝福。渐渐的雪花愈渐密集，仿佛无数的小精灵在天空中欢快的舞蹈，随着风旋律起舞旋转，轻轻飘落到地面，每一片雪花都是大自然的诗诗行，实行都是冬日的一抹柔情，我不由自主的放下手中的笔，凝望窗外的雪景，那一刻我的心突然变得异常宁静，所有的学习压力和作业的烦恼都在这一刻烟消云散。隔着玻璃我似乎能闻到雪花的清香，那是一种彻底净化心灵的清香。雪花悄无声息地覆盖了一切，也悄悄地洗涤我内心的浮躁，让我有感到一种久违的轻松与愉悦。随着雪越下越大，校园内的树木操场甚至屋檐都被盖上了一层薄薄的白雪，整个世界仿佛披上了一层洁白的纱衣柔和而安静，空气中弥漫着雪的气息，一切都变得格外清晰，格外宁静。那一刻我忍不住开始幻想，下课后我将在草地上肆意的奔跑，脚踩着松软的积雪上发出嘎吱嘎吱雷声响，那种无忧无虑的快乐像阳光一样驱散了心中所有的阴霾。我们像一群失去羁绊的孩子，沉浸在这雪白的世界里，直到天色暗淡下来，回忆起那些飘扬的雪花，我依旧能感觉到那份放下所有的烦恼的轻松与喜悦。那一天像是为我洗涤内心的尘埃带来了无尽的欢乐和温暖。生活中的美好往往就在我们不经意间悄悄降临。,winter year junior high school cold wind howled wildly window frozen cold appearance time step classroom piercing chill pierce skin merciless blade making impossible breathe cold sunlight mischievously streamed window classroom quietly covering desk light gentle brilliant warm friend gently caressing heart cold winter bringing hint tranquility comfort morning buried shoulder shoulder textbook homework reading lightning speed notebook time slipped quietly noticing cold winter window quietly brewing surprise knowledge point blackboard intense review space heart time didnt beautiful time life unintentionally afternoon setting sun gradually tilted westward sky gradually dimmed hazy sky foreshadowing happen suddenly snowflake danced freely snowflake fell slowly light feather seemingly gentlest blessing sky gradually snowflake denser denser countless elf dancing joyfully sky dancing spinning wind melody gently falling ground snowflake poetry nature implementation touch tenderness winter pen gaze snow scenery window moment heart suddenly unusually peaceful study pressure homework trouble disappeared moment glass smell fragrance snowflake scent purifies soul snowflake silently covered washed restlessness making feel long lost sense ease joy snow grew heavier heavier tree playground eaves campus covered layer white snow draped soft quiet white veil air filled scent snow clear peaceful moment fantasize class freely grass stepping soft snow making creaking sound carefree joy dispelled gloom heart sunshine group child lost bond immersed snowwhite sky darkens recalling fluttering snowflake feel ease joy letting worry day washing dust heart bringing endless joy warmth beauty life quietly descends unintentionally

Because Chengdu is a very dynamic and culturally rich city, and its overall atmosphere is very relaxed. I fell in love right away, and what impressed me the most was that the locals were exceptionally friendly, which made our entire journey very enjoyable because they were always willing to help. Of course, if you're in Chengdu, you must try Sichuan cuisine. For example, we went to many small restaurants and roadside stalls at that time, and the most impressive one was definitely hotpot. We also tasted Mapo tofu and Dandan noodles, which are very delicious, but they are too old. Sometimes they have diarrhea. The most unforgettable stop of this trip was one of the legal research centers for giant pandas in Chengdu. Nowadays, those big men and pandas are gnawing on bamboo and playing, they are really cute, and they can't bear to leave. In addition, we also went to the Kuanzhai Alley where there were many old-fashioned buildings. We also tried some traditional snacks and bought some specialty products. I think the most impressive and my favorite place in Chengdu is its leisurely pace of life. Although it is a big city, it doesn't feel rushed. Life doesn't necessarily have to be different from that of a big first tier city, but it is also very bustling. Its delicious food and rich culture make this trip particularly meaningful. I really hope to visit Chengdu again in the future. Well, I also believe that Chengdu is a very livable city, and it may be worth considering retirement in Chengdu.

Before departure, I gained a preliminary understanding and strong interest in the history and culture of England through British dramas such as Downton Abbey, The Crown, and Queen Victoria. These TV series gave me a direct understanding of the aristocratic life, royal history, and the glory of the Victorian era in Britain. Our journey begins in London, a city renowned for its rich historical sites and cultural atmosphere. Although Big Ben was under maintenance when we arrived and we couldn't get a full view of it, it didn't diminish our love for this city. We strolled through the streets of London, experiencing the unique charm of the city. We took a cruise on the Thames River, and the scenery on both sides was like flowing scrolls of art, leaving us dazzled. We visited the historic Royal Naval Academy, visited the Greenwich Observatory, and also visited St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey. The grandeur and delicacy of these buildings gave us a deeper understanding of religion and architectural art in Britain. It's hard to see sunny weather in London, most of which are gray. Occasionally, there may be light rain on cloudy days, but this doesn't affect our interest in traveling, instead it adds a touch of British style. London in the rain has a unique romance and poetry. We shuttle through the ancient streets with umbrellas, as if we have also become a part of those British dramas. After our trip to London, we went to Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, which is famous for its ancient castles, narrow streets, and rich cultural activities. In Edinburgh, we seem to have traveled back to the Middle Ages and experienced the history and culture of Scotland. We visited Edinburgh Castle, learned about the royal history of Scotland, and strolled along the Royal Mile, experiencing the vitality and charm of the city. This trip to the UK not only allowed me to personally experience the history and culture of the country, but also gave me a deeper understanding and recognition of the world. Every city, every building, and every street carries stories and tells history. These experiences are like precious treasures that will forever be cherished in my memory.",0,54,在2018年的暑假，我刚刚从初中毕业，于是我和母亲一同踏上了向往已久的英国之旅。在出发前，我通过唐顿庄园、皇冠、维多利亚女王等英剧，对英国的历史和文化有了初步的了解和浓厚的兴趣。这些剧集让我对英国的贵族生活，王室历史和维多利亚时代的辉煌有了直观的感受。我们的旅程从伦敦开始，这座城市以其丰富的历史遗迹和文化氛围而闻名。尽管我们到达时，大本钟正在维修，未能一睹其全貌，但这并没有减少我们对这个城市的热爱。我们在伦敦的街头漫步，感受着这座城市独特的魅力，乘坐游轮在泰晤士河上缓缓前行，两岸的风光如同一幅幅流动的画画卷，让人目不暇接。我们参观历史悠久的皇家海军学院，探访了格林尼治天文台，还参观了圣保罗大教堂和威斯敏斯特大教堂，这些建筑的宏伟与精致让我们对英国的宗教和建筑艺术有了更深的认识。伦敦的天气晴天很难一见，大多数都是灰蒙蒙的，阴天偶尔还会下起小雨，但这并没有影响我们的游览兴致，反而增添了一份英伦风情。雨中的伦敦有着别样的浪漫和诗意，我们撑着伞穿梭在古老的街道上，仿佛自己也成为了那些英剧中的一员。在伦敦的行程结束后，我们又前往了苏格兰的首府爱丁堡，这座城市以其古老的城堡，狭窄的街道和丰富的文化活动而闻名。在爱丁堡，我们仿佛穿越回了中世纪，感受到了苏格兰的历史和文化。我们参观了爱丁堡城堡，了解了苏格兰的王室历史，还漫步在皇家英里大道上，感受着这座城市的活力与魅力。这次英国之旅不仅让我亲身体验了英国的历史和文化，也让我对这个世界有了更深的理解和认识。每一座城市，每一座建筑，每一条街道都承载着故事，讲述着历史，这些经历如同宝贵的财富，会永远珍藏在我的记忆中。,summer graduated junior high school mother embarked longawaited journey uk departure gained preliminary understanding strong history culture england british drama downton abbey crown queen victoria tv series direct understanding aristocratic life royal history glory victorian era britain journey london city renowned rich historical site cultural atmosphere big ben maintenance arrived view didnt diminish love city strolled street london experiencing unique charm city cruise thames river scenery side flowing scroll art leaving dazzled visited historic royal naval academy visited greenwich observatory visited st paul cathedral westminster abbey grandeur delicacy building deeper understanding religion architectural art britain hard sunny weather london gray occasionally light rain cloudy day doesnt affect traveling add touch british style london rain unique romance poetry shuttle ancient street umbrella british drama trip london edinburgh capital scotland famous ancient castle narrow street rich cultural activity edinburgh traveled middle age experienced history culture scotland visited edinburgh castle learned royal history scotland strolled royal mile experiencing vitality charm city trip uk allowed personally experience history culture country deeper understanding recognition city building street carry story tell history experience precious treasure cherished memory

This trip has allowed me to experience a country that is both modern and full of traditional cultural atmosphere, and every day makes me feel excited and satisfied. On the first day, I came to Universal Studios in Osaka. This place was always on my list of plans. When I entered the Harry Potter area of the park, everyone was excited and jumped up. The magnificent Hogwarts Castle in the movie is now standing before my eyes, and the feeling is unbelievable. Walking on the path, I feel like I have truly entered a magical world, and even the surrounding air seems to have become magical. Then I went to Xiaohuangren, where there was a very interesting VR experience project. During the game, I felt like I was flying in the sky, shuttling through various scenes, but in reality, I was just sitting in place. This project allowed me to fully experience the charm of technology, which was both thrilling and fun. In the evening, I was very lucky to catch a flower drum festival, where fireworks bloomed in the night sky, colorful, accompanied by the music of fireworks, and the whole night seemed to be lit up. The beauty of fireworks makes me marvel, and the scenery of this moment will forever be imprinted in my memory. The next day, I arrived at Nara Park, a famous attraction with many small paths that were completely unafraid of people and even approached them voluntarily. I bought some deer fairy shells to feed them, and these cute little ones surrounded me gently nibbling on the food in their hands. Being able to have close contact with these animals made me feel the harmony between humans and nature, and also filled my day with warmth. Afterwards, I went to Mount Fuji and on the way to the foot of the mountain, we passed the famous music road. As the wheels rolled over the road, they actually played a beautiful melody. This wonderful design has opened my eyes. At the foot of Mount Fuji, I took a photo of Rosen Convenience Store framed with Mount Fuji, which was a particularly memorable moment of this trip. On the third day, I visited Osaka Castle Park and felt the weight of history. I also went to the palace where the emperor lived. On the last day, I arrived at Yokohama Chinatown and saw that traditional Chinese culture was also warmly welcomed in Japan. My heart was filled with pride and emotion. This trip to Japan has brought me many wonderful memories and made me look forward to my next trip even more. I hope to have the opportunity to go again and continue exploring this beautiful country.",0,58,在初三的暑假我终于实现了自己的心愿去了日本旅行。这次旅行让我见识到了一个既现代又充满传统文化气息的国家，每一天都让我感到兴奋和满足。第一天我来到了大阪的环球影城，这个地方总是在我的计划清单中，当我进入园区的哈利波特区时，整个人都激动的快跳起来了。电影中那个宏伟壮观的霍格沃兹城堡此刻真真实实地矗立在我眼前，那种感觉简直难以置信，我走在小路上仿佛真的进入了魔法世界，连周围的空气都好像变得有魔力。接着我去了小黄人去，这里有一个非常有趣的VR体验项目，在游玩过程中，我觉得自己好像在天上飞翔，穿梭于各种场景之中，但实际上我只是坐在原地，这个项目让我充分感受到了科技的魅力，既惊险又好玩，晚上我非常幸运地赶上了一场花鼓大会，烟花在夜空中绽放，五光十色，伴随着打上花火这首音乐，整个夜晚仿佛都被点亮了。烟花的美丽让我不禁感慨，这一刻的景色将永远印刻在我的记忆中。第二天我来到了奈良公园，这是一个著名的景点，园区里有许多小路，他们完全不怕人的，甚至会主动靠近你，我买了一些鹿仙贝喂他们，这些可爱的小家伙围着我温柔地啃着手中的食物，能够与这些动物零距离接触，让我感受到人与自然的和谐，也让我这一天充满温暖。之后我去过富士山，在通往山脚的路上，我们经过了著名的音乐公路，车轮碾过路面时，竟然真的奏响了一首美妙的旋律。这种奇妙的设计让我大开眼界。在富士山脚下，我拍了一张罗森便利店与富士山同框的照片，这是这趟旅行中特别有纪念意义的一刻。第三天我参观了大阪城公园，感受到了历史的厚重感，还去了一趟天皇居住的宫殿。最后一天我来到了横滨中华城，看到中国的传统文化在日本也受到热烈欢迎，心中满是自豪和感动。这趟日本之旅让我收获了许多美好的回忆，也让我更加期待下一次的旅行。我希望有机会再去一次继续探索这个美丽的国度。,finally fulfilled travel japan summer vacation year junior high school trip allowed experience country modern traditional cultural atmosphere day feel excited satisfied day universal studio osaka place list plan entered harry potter area park excited jumped magnificent hogwarts castle movie standing eye feeling unbelievable walking path feel entered magical surrounding air magical xiaohuangren interesting vr experience project game felt flying sky shuttling scene reality sitting place project allowed fully experience charm technology thrilling fun evening lucky catch flower drum festival firework bloomed night sky colorful accompanied music firework night lit beauty firework marvel scenery moment imprinted memory day arrived nara park famous attraction small path completely unafraid people approached voluntarily bought deer fairy shell feed cute surrounded gently nibbling food hand close contact animal feel harmony human nature filled day warmth mount fuji foot mountain passed famous music road wheel rolled road played beautiful melody wonderful design opened eye foot mount fuji photo rosen convenience store framed mount fuji memorable moment trip day visited osaka castle park felt weight history palace emperor lived day arrived yokohama chinatown traditional chinese culture warmly welcomed japan heart filled pride emotion trip japan brought wonderful memory trip hope opportunity continue exploring beautiful country

Well, I was very young at that time, but I didn't know how high Mount Taishan was and what difficulties I would encounter on the way, so I followed. But if I were now, I would probably not choose to climb the mountain. Because climbing mountains is really too tiring for me. Anyway, at that time, I was walking along the winding mountain road, and I was really exhausted and panting. But all of them kept saying, 'Just climb a little more and you'll reach the top.' Anyway, they were always deceived and climbed up. Well, while crawling, there were those people selling drinks and grilled sausages on the roadside. I can't remember if there were any grilled sausages left, anyway, they were just selling some expensive food. So it seems like we carried some water ourselves at that time, and I'm even more tired this week. However, the more interesting thing about climbing Mount Taishan is that the scenery on the road is not bad. Looking down from a high place, a large area is green, which really makes people feel good. Ah, but there's one more thing that left a deep impression on me when looking down from a high place. There was a small section where the steps were a bit too steep, and I was quite scared at the time. Anyway, I was sitting directly on that step, leaning back because I was afraid of falling. Well, overall, it was already evening when we climbed to the top, and we bought a thick cotton coat, but I think it was very dirty. At that time, I seemed to have stayed for a little night, preparing to wake up the next morning to watch the sunrise. I remember it was particularly cold at that time, and I didn't seem to see the sunrise. In my impression, it was all blocked by clouds. Uh huh. Well, it's interesting on the whole. I'm not so tired when I go down the mountain, but I'm a little afraid when I go down the mountain. I'm really afraid of falling down. Anyway, I talked and laughed all the way.

For this trip to Saipan Island, we did a lot of homework in advance. The activities on Saipan Island were very diverse, and what attracted me the most were diving and jungle exploration. On the first day, we arrived at Warship Island and I signed up for a snorkeling trip. First, we arrived on the island by speedboat, changed into snorkeling equipment, and followed the diving instructor to dive into the water. The underwater world is truly awe inspiring. Various colorful fish shuttle through the coral reefs, and the tour guide even took us to a place where turtles gather. We saw turtles swimming gracefully in the water, which were scenes I had never seen before. The next day, I went on an adventure in the jungle. The tropical rainforest of Saipan Island was full of mystery. My leader and I chose a blue cave route, which passed through dense forests. Along the way, we could see many local plants and birds. As we advanced on this route, we stood at the edge of the cliff overlooking the natural caves formed by the impact of seawater on the rocks. The blue seawater shone with a charming light in the sunlight, which was truly amazing. Another thing not to miss on Saipan Island is its cuisine, with many dishes that blend local American flavors. I really like the local coconut crab, and the restaurant owner even taught us how to eat this large crab correctly. The crab has tender and juicy meat, and when paired with local dipping sauce, it has a unique flavor. On the last day, I also experienced the famous sunset on Saipan Island. Arriving at the highest point of the island, Bird Island Observation Deck, I waited for the sun to set in the west, sitting on the edge of the cliff watching the sun slowly fall to the horizon. My heart was filled with tranquility and satisfaction. This trip to Saipan Island allowed me to appreciate the beauty of nature and the rich cultural experiences. I was a little reluctant to leave him, hoping that I would have another chance to come to this beautiful island.",1,65,上个假期我去了塞班岛旅游，那确实是一个让人流连忘返的地方。为了这次塞班岛之行，我们提前做了不少功课，在塞班岛的活动非常丰富，最吸引我的就是潜水和丛林探险。第一天我们来到了军舰岛，我报名参加了一个浮潜之旅，首先我们坐快艇抵达到了岛上，换上了浮潜设备，跟着教跟着潜水教练一起潜入了水中。水下的世界真是让人赞叹不已。各种色彩斑斓的鱼在珊瑚丛中穿梭，导游还特地带我们去了一个海龟聚集的地方，看到海龟在水中优雅地游动，这些都是我从来没见过的场景。接下来的一天，我去了丛林探险，塞班岛的热带雨林充满了神秘感，我和领头人选择了一条蓝洞的路线，这条路线穿过茂密的森林，一路上能看到许多当地特有的植物和鸟类，在这条路线前进的时候，我们站在悬崖边俯瞰，能看到海水冲击岩石它形成的天然洞穴，蓝色的海水在阳光下闪着迷人的光芒，属实让人惊叹啊。在塞班岛不能错过的还有它的美食，岛上有许多融合了当地的美国风味的料理。我特别喜欢当地的椰子蟹，餐厅的老板还教我们如何正确的吃这种大型的螃蟹，螃蟹，蟹肉鲜嫩多汁，配上当地特色的蘸料，味道别有一番风味。在最后一天，我还体验了塞班岛著名的日落，来到岛上的最高点，鸟岛观景台等待着太阳西沉，坐在悬崖边看着太阳慢慢落入海平线，心中充满了宁静和满足。这次塞班岛之旅，让我领略到了大自然大自然的瑰丽和丰化丰富的文化体验。我离开他时真有些不舍，希望我还有机会再次来到这个美丽的岛屿。,holiday trip saipan island place left people reluctant leave trip saipan island lot homework advance activity saipan island diverse attracted diving jungle exploration day arrived warship island signed snorkeling trip arrived island speedboat changed snorkeling equipment diving instructor dive water underwater awe inspiring colorful fish shuttle coral reef tour guide place turtle gather turtle swimming gracefully water scene day adventure jungle tropical rainforest saipan island mystery leader chose blue cave route passed dense forest local plant bird advanced route stood edge cliff overlooking natural cave formed impact seawater rock blue seawater shone charming light sunlight amazing saipan island cuisine dish blend local american flavor local coconut crab restaurant owner taught eat large crab correctly crab tender juicy meat paired local dipping sauce unique flavor day experienced famous sunset saipan island arriving highest point island bird island observation deck waited sun set west sitting edge cliff watching sun slowly fall horizon heart filled tranquility satisfaction trip saipan island allowed beauty nature rich cultural experience reluctant leave hoping chance beautiful island

He lives on the other side of the city, which is a place I rarely go to. We haven't seen each other for several months, so this visit was of great significance to me. I planned the route a day in advance to ensure that I didn't miss any important transportation information. In the morning, I put on my favorite blue shirt and brought some homemade cookies as gifts, which are all Li Ming's favorite. Before going out, I checked the weather forecast to make sure that I would not encounter a sudden rainstorm. When I took the subway, I shuttled in the city context, hearing the whispers of people in the car and the roar of the train. Well, my mood is both excited and nervous, imagining the scene of our reunion, the subway passing through the tunnel, the sunlight shining through the window on my face, warm and comfortable. Finally, I arrived at my destination. As I walked past the subway station, it was a winding path lined with lush trees. Walking along the path, I felt the gentle breeze brushing my face and the fragrance of flowers in the distance. My mood also relaxed. Li Ming's home is a cozy little villa with a small garden in front of it. It carefully takes care of the flowers inside. I rang the doorbell, and soon the door opened. Li Ming's smile caught my eye, and we hugged each other. She took the cookies from my hand and thanked us repeatedly for sitting on the sofa in the living room and chatting about our recent situations. Li Ming told me that he has recently started learning horticulture and showed me several new plants he has planted. I shared some of the twists and turns and challenges in my work and studies. Ah, our topic jumps from memories of the past to planning for the future, and time seems to stop at this moment. During our lunch break, we tasted the noodles made by Li Ming himself, paired with the cookies I brought, and the taste was unexpectedly good. Let's take a walk together in the garden in the afternoon, discussing the growth habits of various plants. As the sun sets, I bid farewell to dawn and embarked on the road home. Although my body was a bit tired, my heart was filled with warmth and satisfaction. This visit not only allowed me to relive old friendships, but also allowed me to experience a pleasant city adventure.

As the team captain of the International College of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, I led the team to win the championship by defeating opponents all the way. The most impressive game for me was the final. At the beginning of the game, due to a defensive mistake, we were first scored by the opponent. Later, because there was someone on the other side who felt like he was passing the ball, he made a mistake and dropped it straight up and down towards the goal. The goalkeeper also made a judgment mistake and did not judge the distance to clear the ball, so it fell into the goal. In the first 20 minutes of the game, we conceded two goals, and everyone's morale was relatively low. As the team captain, I shout and encourage my teammates to be more proactive, telling them that it's not a big deal. Our strength is stronger than theirs, so there's no need to be afraid. So towards the end of the first half, we got a corner kick, and I made a corner kick that turned directly towards the goal. Although there were some lucky reasons, we turned towards the goal and ended the first half with a score of 2:1. Then in the second half, we became more and more brave, and because our overall strength was stronger, and we caught up with a ball, it was like blowing the horn of counterattack. In the second half, we first committed a foul on the other side and received a penalty kick. Then, in a melee, we were in the middle of our boat and scored an own goal on the other side. In the end, I passed two people on the flank and then took a cut shot into the corner. Ah, I am very excited. Although it has been six months, I still remember it vividly yesterday. In the end, we defeated our opponents 4-2 and won the Principal's Cup championship. This is also my second championship after winning the high school class competition. And as the captain, I feel very, very happy. I participated in the entire game and made a very, very great contribution to the team. Then our State Council also showed a very united side.

During our conversation, we learned that the old man's calligraphy was particularly good. As soon as I heard this news, I became very interested. The master saw how interested I was and enthusiastically led me to visit his study. As soon as I entered, I saw many beautiful and magnificent handwriting hanging on the wall. I was so surprised that I opened my mouth wide and couldn't help but sigh. I also wanted to write such beautiful words. The master immediately took out a piece of rice paper and started writing. I saw his momentum like a rainbow, his writing was very decisive, and he had perseverance. After laughing a few times, he wrote a few words. Upon closer inspection, I noticed the words' Endless Learning 'written on the paper. At this moment, my grandfather spoke earnestly to me,' Learning is endless on a child's life journey. You should always maintain a humble and eager to learn attitude in all aspects of life, including acquiring knowledge, improving personal cultivation, and so on. You should not be arrogant or complacent, but continue to pursue more knowledge and higher realms. It is our way of writing, just like how I write calligraphy. '.

This trip was very special for me because Hangzhou is a place I've always wanted to go to but haven't. And this friend from Hangzhou is my high school classmate. Since we started college, we have been busy on our own and haven't seen each other again. That morning, I sat out of the high-speed train window in Hangzhou and the scenery gradually changed from the bustling city to green mountains and waters. Along the way, I was full of anticipation. When I arrived in Hangzhou, my friend picked me up at the station. At the moment we met, we both smiled, as if we were back in high school. He took me to the old street he recommended, which is a very quiet pedestrian street lined with old houses and small shops. He said it preserves his memories of two years in college and is one of his favorite places. We first sat down on the street and drank a bowl of hot osmanthus lotus root powder, which had a faint sweetness and osmanthus aroma, and then felt a warmth of home. I slowly walked on the old street and looked at the small stalls selling handicrafts. My friend told me a story about what happened during his two-year stay here during the reign of Emperor Yu. He said he didn't always come when he was sad or happy. This pedestrian street is for relaxing and leisure activities. I looked at his smile as if I could see what he looked like on this street at the time. In the afternoon, we went to West Lake, and the willows by the lake had already turned slightly yellow. The lake was shimmering with golden light in the sunlight. We rented a small boat and slid slowly to the center of the lake, where the wind was light and cool. It seemed like we had talked a lot about his college life, his hobbies, and his plans for the future. We also talked about the bits and pieces of high school days when we stayed up late to memorize manuscripts and went out to play together. Time passed quickly, as the sunset gradually set and the lake was dyed orange red. That night, we had dinner at a small restaurant by the lake. Although it was just a home cooked meal, it was particularly delicious without the company of old friends. After dinner, we took a walk by the lake, watching the distant lights reflecting on the surface of the lake, like countless stars scattered in the water. I took a deep breath and felt that the tranquility and beauty of this moment would forever remain in my memory.",0,77,去年秋天在国庆假期期间我去了杭州，采访了一个多年未见的朋友，这次旅程对我来说非常特别，因为杭州是我一直想去还没有去去的地方。而这位杭州而这位朋友是我的高中同学，我们自从上大学后就各自忙碌，再也没有见面。那天我一早坐上去杭州的高铁车窗外景色从繁华的城市逐渐变成青山绿水，一路上我充满期待，到达杭州后朋友在车站接我，我们见面的那一刻彼此都笑了，仿佛回到了高中时光。他带我去了他推荐的那条老街，那是一条非常安静的步行街，两旁是老旧的房屋和小商铺，他说这里保留了他在大学时期两年的记忆，是他最喜欢的地方之一。我们在街边首先坐下喝了一碗热乎乎的桂花藕粉，那种淡淡的甜味和桂花的香气，然后感受到了一种家的温暖。我慢慢走在老街上看着那些卖手工艺品的小摊，朋友给我讲述了他在这里两年大禹之际发生的故事，他说他没当难过时或有什么开心的事情都会来。这条步行街散心游玩。我看着他的笑容仿佛也看到了他当时在这条街的样子，下午的时候我们去了西湖，湖边的柳树已经微微泛黄，湖水在阳光下闪烁着金色的光芒，我们租了一只小船慢悠悠地滑到湖心，湖面上风很轻，带着淡淡的凉意，好像和我们聊了很多关于他的大学生活，他的兴趣爱好，还有他对未来的打算。我们也聊起了高中时点点滴滴那些我们一起熬夜背稿，一起出去玩的日子时间过得很快，夕阳渐渐西沉，湖面上被染上一片橙红色。那天晚上我们在湖边的小饭馆吃了一顿晚餐，虽然只是一顿家常菜，但没有老朋友的陪伴，显得格外美味。饭后我们散步在湖边，看着远处的灯火，倒映在湖面上，像是无数的星星洒落在水中，我深吸一口气，感觉这一刻的宁静和美好将永远留在我的记忆中。,autumn national day holiday hangzhou interview friend hadnt year trip special hangzhou place ive wanted havent friend hangzhou high school classmate started college busy havent morning sat highspeed train window hangzhou scenery gradually changed bustling city green mountain water anticipation arrived hangzhou friend picked station moment met smiled high school street recommended quiet pedestrian street lined house small shop preserve memory year college favorite place sat street drank bowl hot osmanthus lotus root powder faint sweetness osmanthus aroma felt warmth slowly walked street looked small stall selling handicraft friend told story happened twoyear stay reign emperor yu didnt sad happy pedestrian street relaxing leisure activity looked smile looked street time afternoon west lake willow lake turned yellow lake shimmering golden light sunlight rented small boat slid slowly center lake wind light cool talked lot college life hobby plan future talked bit piece high school day stayed late memorize manuscript play time passed sunset gradually set lake dyed orange red night dinner small restaurant lake cooked meal delicious company friend dinner walk lake watching distant light reflecting surface lake countless star scattered water deep breath felt tranquility beauty moment remain memory

Driven by curiosity, I made up my mind to explore with my friends. When we arrived at the village, it was already evening. The village was located deep in a dense bamboo forest, and the houses were made of wood and green bricks, looking like relics preserved from ancient times. The village used very little electricity, and every household relied mainly on oil lamps for lighting. The villagers are often very curious about foreign tourists, but they are all very friendly. Several villagers invited me to their homes for a meal and rest. After dinner, the old man began to tell a legend about a village that was once the habitat of a hermit. He had a magical ability to summon animals in the mountains with a bamboo flute. It is said that this kind of creaking sound can not only attract deer and birds, but also heal injured animals. I am very curious about this. Requesting the elderly to visit the assistant of the hermit. The old man took me to a small house behind the village, where there was indeed an ancient bamboo flute placed. I carefully picked up the flute and tried playing it. However, something unexpected happened when the sounds of birds and deer came from outside. The old man smiled and nodded, saying that this was the magic of this flute. Although I cannot fully believe in the authenticity of this legend, the experience of that night remains unforgettable to this day.

He is studying civil engineering at Chang'an University. My civil engineering classmates in China are often ridiculed, and he is no exception. I often joke about his major. He planned to take me on a tour of Xi'an, but later our plan changed. We went to another city in Shaanxi Province, Baoji City, because we considered that there were too many people in Xi'an and holidays, so we went to other cities. And he was already tired of visiting Xi'an, so we unanimously decided to go to a new place, Baoji City. We bought station tickets back and forth from Xi'an to Baoji, mainly because the hard seats were sold out. Baoji is indeed an 18 tier small city, and hotels of the same specifications are several times more expensive in Beijing. When we arrived at the station, what we saw was desolation. We saw the roads and high-rise buildings under construction, and sure enough, the ride hailing services here were very inconvenient and difficult to book, but taxis were also too expensive. So we took the bus out to play, which was also run down. It was still very hot in summer, and we didn't even want to turn on the air conditioning inside the bus. The only place worth visiting was the Bronze Museum. When we arrived at the Bronze Museum, we were already very tired. Although the Bronze Museum looked particularly magnificent, we didn't have the energy to visit anymore. So we found a seat to rest for a while, and the mood to visit was gone. In the end, we took a quick look and the only thing that left the deepest impression on us was his tripod like appearance. Then we went back to the hotel. As soon as we arrived, we didn't want to go out and hadn't seen each other for a long time. So we stayed in the hotel for two days, playing games. We took a nap during the day, ordered takeout until noon, and played games until late at night. On this trip, we went to a bronze museum. Finally, when we left, we went to the bustling night market and wanted to eat some snacks to make up for our regret. However, the homogenization of snacks here was too severe and there was no distinctive feature. After a long wait for roasted pig trotters, the taste was mediocre and can only be described as tasteless. Minxin, who we have been waiting for a long time, has no taste without chili, but after adding chili, there is only a little bit of spiciness left. My own trip can only be described as a bit regretful, but I am also visiting my old friend. Anyway, it is acceptable.",0,81,大二下半学期我去陕西西安拜访了我的高中同学，他就读于长安大学，他是学土木的。在中国土木系同学是经常受调侃的，他也不例外，我经常调侃他的专业，他计划带我逛逛西安，但后来我们的计划改变了，我们去了陕西省的另一个市宝鸡市，因为我们考虑到了西安人太多，因为节假日人太多了，所以我们就去了其他市，并且他已经是逛腻了西安，所以我们就一致决定去个新地方，宝鸡市。我们从西安到宝鸡来回买了站票，主要是硬座卖光了，宝鸡不愧是18线小城市，同样规格的酒店在北京得贵好几倍，到站后映入眼帘的是荒凉，看到了正在建设中的马路和高楼，果然这边的网约车十分不方便，特别难约，但是出租车又太贵了。于是我们坐公交出去玩，公交车同样也是破破烂烂的，那时还是大大大夏天天气非常炎热，车内连空调都不舍得开，唯一值得去的地方就是青铜博物馆了。我们到青铜博物馆的时候已经很累了，尽管青铜博物馆看起来特别的宏伟，但是的话我们已经没有精力去逛了，于是我们就找了个座位休息了一会儿，参观的心情都没了。最后我们走马观花的看了一遍，印象最深的只有他的那个像一个鼎一样的一个外观，随后我们就回酒店了，我们一到酒店根本就不想出去了，而且好久没有见面了，于是我们俩就在酒店里待了两天，玩两天游戏，白天睡午觉，睡到中午点个外卖，然后打游戏到深夜这一趟我们就去了个青铜博物馆，最后离开的时候，我们就去了一下热闹的夜市，想吃一些小吃，弥补一下遗憾，结果这边的小吃同质化过于严重，没有什么特色。排了很久的烤猪蹄，结果味道很一般，只能用索然无味来形容。我们等了很久的敏欣也是不加辣椒什么味道都没有，但是加了后辣椒后却只剩一点辣味了，自己的游玩只能用些许遗憾来形容，不过我也是为了拜访我的老朋友，总之还可以接受。,sophomore year visited high school classmate xian shaanxi studying civil engineering changan university civil engineering classmate china ridiculed exception joke major planned tour xian plan changed city shaanxi province baoji city considered people xian holiday city tired visiting xian unanimously decided place baoji city bought station ticket xian baoji hard seat sold baoji tier small city hotel specification time expensive beijing arrived station desolation road highrise building construction ride hailing service inconvenient difficult book taxi expensive bus play hot summer didnt turn air conditioning bus place worth visiting bronze museum arrived bronze museum tired bronze museum looked magnificent didnt energy visit seat rest mood visit quick left deepest impression tripod appearance hotel arrived didnt hadnt long time stayed hotel day playing game nap day ordered takeout noon played game late night trip bronze museum finally left bustling night market wanted eat snack regret homogenization snack severe distinctive feature long wait roasted pig trotter taste mediocre tasteless minxin waiting long time taste chili adding chili bit spiciness left trip bit regretful visiting friend acceptable

This was my first time going to Hangzhou, and I had only seen his appearance in books and movies before. On the day I arrived, it rained slightly, and the entire West Lake was shrouded in a thin mist, making it even more mysterious and poetic. Walking on the Su Causeway, along the winding path, one can occasionally see the willows on the shore gently swaying in the breeze, causing ripples on the water surface as if beckoning to me. Later, I rented a small hand rowed boat and slowly rowed towards the center of the lake. The boatman is an elderly man over sixty years old, and he happily told me the story of the White Snake with a smile on his face. When Xu Xian and Bai Niangzi met at the Broken Bridge, he pointed to the distant suspension bridge and sighed, 'Ah, it's there that the legend really makes people believe in love.'. At that moment, I felt like I had traveled back thousands of years to Jiangnan. At noon, I went to Louwailou to try authentic Hangzhou food, and ordered West Lake Fish in Vinegar Sauce and Fried Shrimps with Longjing Tea. When the waiter brought it up, I saw that the fish meat was fresh and tender, with a moderate sour and sweet taste, while the shrimp had a refreshing tea aroma, which really made my appetite boil. During the meal, I happened to see West Lake outside the window, and even the mood of eating became particularly beautiful. In the afternoon, I decided to climb the Leifeng Pagoda. From the top of the pagoda, I could see the entire West Lake in full view. The shocking feeling was indescribable in words. The distant mountains undulate, the nearby lake shimmers, and the surrounding tourists seem to have become embellishments in the painting. In the evening, I strolled in Hefang Street, where there were many snack stalls, and I tasted several kinds of snacks, especially a traditional Dim sum called Dingsheng Cake. It was soft, glutinous, sweet, and memorable. As I was walking, I also came across a handicraft shop where the owner enthusiastically introduced Hangzhou's silk culture. I bought a handmade embroidered scarf as a souvenir and felt that this trip was even more perfect. Today, I climbed the Leileilei Peak Tower, went to the Hangzhou food in the building outside the building, tasted local Hangzhou food, and went to the snack street to taste all kinds of Dim sum, especially Dingsheng Cake, which was just a few days' trip to Hangzhou, and let me experience the tenderness and charm of Jiangnan. Although I felt a bit reluctant when I left, I know this memory will always stay in my heart.",1,84,去年暑假我去了杭州，专门为了西湖的美景，这是我第一次去杭州，之前只在书上和电影上看到过他的模样，到达那天天微微下着小雨，整个西湖笼罩在一层薄雾中，显得更加神秘而诗意。走在苏堤上，沿着蜿蜒的小路，偶尔能看到岸边的柳树被微风轻轻拂动，水面上荡漾起了阵阵涟漪，仿佛在向我招手。后来我租了一艘手划小船慢慢划向湖中心。船夫是一位年过6旬的老爷爷，他满脸笑容兴致勃勃地给我讲起了白蛇传的故事。说到许仙和白娘子在断桥相遇时，他还指着远处的吊桥感慨道，唉就在那里传说真的让人相信爱情。那一刻我仿佛穿越到了千百年前的江南。中午我去了楼外楼尝试极道地道的杭州菜，点了西湖醋鱼和龙井虾仁。服务员端上来的时候，我看到鱼肉鲜嫩，酸甜适中，虾仁则带着一股清香的茶香味，真是让我食欲大开。用餐时窗外正好看见西湖，连吃饭的心情都变得特别美好。下午我决定登雷峰塔，从塔顶幅看，整个西湖尽收眼底，那种震撼的感觉无法用言语形容。远处的群山连绵起伏，近处的湖光波光粼粼，周围的游人仿佛成了画中的点缀。晚上我在河坊街闲逛，那里小吃摊林立，热闹非凡，我尝了几种小吃，特别是一种叫做定胜糕的传统点心，软糯香甜，让人回味无穷。走着走着我还碰到了一家手工艺品铺子，店主热情地介绍起了杭州的丝绸文化，我买了一条手工刺绣的丝巾作为纪念，觉得这次这次旅行更加的完美了。今天我登了雷雷雷峰塔，也去了楼外楼的杭州菜，尝了尝当地的杭州菜，也去了小吃街，尝了各种各样的点心，尤其是定胜糕短短几天的杭州之行，让我体会到了江南的温柔与韵味。虽然离开时心里有些不舍，但我知道这段记忆会永远留在我的心底。,summer hangzhou beautiful scenery west lake time hangzhou appearance book movie day arrived rained entire west lake shrouded mist making mysterious poetic walking su causeway winding path occasionally willow shore gently swaying breeze causing ripple water surface beckoning rented small hand rowed boat slowly rowed center lake boatman elderly man year happily told story white snake smile face xu xian bai niangzi met broken bridge pointed distant suspension bridge sighed legend people love moment felt traveled thousand year jiangnan noon louwailou authentic hangzhou food ordered west lake fish vinegar sauce fried shrimp longjing tea waiter brought fish meat fresh tender moderate sour sweet taste shrimp refreshing tea aroma appetite boil meal happened west lake window mood eating beautiful afternoon decided climb leifeng pagoda pagoda entire west lake view shocking feeling indescribable distant mountain undulate nearby lake shimmer surrounding tourist embellishment painting evening strolled hefang street snack stall tasted kind snack traditional dim sum called dingsheng cake soft glutinous sweet memorable walking handicraft shop owner enthusiastically introduced hangzhou silk culture bought handmade embroidered scarf souvenir felt trip perfect today climbed leileilei peak tower hangzhou food building building tasted local hangzhou food snack street taste kind dim sum dingsheng cake day trip hangzhou experience tenderness charm jiangnan felt bit reluctant left memory stay heart

In class, I always sat silently in the corner watching my classmates play and laugh, but I didn't dare to join in. I was afraid of being rejected and embarrassed, and this fear followed me like a shadow, causing me to miss many beautiful times. I remember once my class organized a speech competition, and watching my classmates confidently step onto the podium and give passionate speeches, my heart was filled with envy. I wish I could bravely stand in front of everyone like them and express my ideas. However, when the teacher asked me if I was willing to participate, I lowered my head and dared not answer. I was afraid that I would be too nervous to speak and afraid that my classmates would mock my timidity. This experience has made me even more disappointed with myself. I feel like a failure, but the turning point of fate often happens unintentionally, on a sunny afternoon. I accidentally came across a book about courage and growth in the library. The protagonist in the book gradually grew from a timid and afraid person to a brave and strong one. His story deeply moved me, and I began to reflect on myself. Why couldn't I face my fears bravely like him? I have decided to change myself. Since then, I have been actively communicating with my classmates. Although I was nervous at first, I forced myself to persevere. I participated in school club activities and tried to express my opinions in front of everyone. Gradually, I found that I was no longer so afraid of socializing with others, and my confidence gradually increased. However, the path of growth was not smooth sailing. When I was in high school, my family encountered a major upheaval. My father's business failed, and the family fell into financial difficulties. Watching my parents work hard for a living filled me with guilt and anxiety. I felt that I should take some responsibility for the family, so I began to use my spare time to work and earn money. Although those days were tough, they also taught me to be strong and independent. I understand the hardships of life and cherish every opportunity to learn even more. I study hard and hope to change the fate of my family through my own efforts. After the college entrance examination, I was admitted to an ideal university where I continued to work hard, actively participate in various social practice activities, and constantly improve my abilities. I also joined a volunteer team to teach in impoverished areas and help children in need. This experience has deeply impressed me with the joy and significance of helping others. Now that I have graduated from college and entered the workforce, looking back on the past, I am filled with emotions. The difficulties and setbacks of the past have now become precious treasures in my life. I am no longer the timid child, but a brave, strong, and confident person.",0,86,小时候我是一个极其内向的孩子，在班级里我总是默默的坐在角落里看着同学们嬉笑玩耍，自己却不敢加入其中，我害怕被拒绝，害怕出丑，这种恐惧如影随形，使我错过了许多美好的时光。记得有一次班级里组织了一场演讲比赛，看着同学们一个个自信满满走上讲台，声情并茂的演讲，我心中充满了羡慕，我多么希望自己也能像他们一样勇敢地站在众人面前表达自己的想法。然而当老师问到我是否愿意参加时，我却低下头不敢回答，我害怕自己会紧张的说不出话来，害怕同学们会嘲笑我的胆怯。这次经历让我对自己更加失望，我觉得自己是一个失败者，但是命运的转折往往在不经意间出现，那是一个阳光明媚的下午。我在图书馆偶然看到一本关于勇气和成长的书，书中的主人公从一个胆小怕事的人逐渐成长为一个勇敢坚强的人，他的故事深深地打动了我，我开始反思自己，为什么我不能像他一样勇敢的面对自己的恐惧呢？我决定改变自己。从那之后我开始主动与同学们交流，虽然一开始很紧张，但我强迫自己坚持下去。我参加了学校的社团社团活动，尝试着在众人面前发表自己的意见，慢慢的我发现自己不再那么害怕与人交往了，我的自信心也逐渐增强。然而成长的道路并非一帆风顺，在我上高中的时候家庭遭遇了一场重大的变故，父亲的生意失败，家里陷入了经济困难，看着父母为了生活奔波劳累，我心中充满了愧疚和不安，我觉得自己应该为家庭承担一些责任，于是我开始利用课余时间打工赚钱。那段日子虽然很辛苦，但是也让我学会了坚强和独立。我明白了生活的不易，也更加珍惜每一个学习的机会。我努力学习，希望能通过自己的努力改变家庭的命运。高考结束后我考上了一所理想的大学，在大学里我继续努力奋斗，积极参加各种社会实践活动，不断提升自己的能力。我还加入了志愿者团队去贫困地区支教，帮助那些需要帮助的孩子。这段经历让我深刻地体会到了帮助他人的快乐和意义。如今我已经大学毕业走上了工作岗位，回首过去我感慨万千，那些曾经的困难和挫折如今都成了我人生中宝贵的财富。我不再是那个胆小怕事的孩子，而是一个勇敢坚强自信的人。,child extremely introverted child class sat silently corner watching classmate play laugh didnt join afraid rejected embarrassed fear shadow causing beautiful time remember class organized speech competition watching classmate confidently step podium passionate speech heart filled envy bravely stand express idea teacher asked participate lowered head dared answer afraid nervous speak afraid classmate mock timidity experience disappointed feel failure turning point fate unintentionally sunny afternoon accidentally book courage growth library protagonist book gradually grew timid afraid person brave strong story deeply moved began reflect face fear bravely decided change actively communicating classmate nervous forced persevere participated school club activity express opinion gradually longer afraid socializing confidence gradually increased path growth smooth sailing high school family encountered major upheaval father business failed family fell financial difficulty watching parent work hard living filled guilt anxiety felt responsibility family began spare time work earn money day tough taught strong independent understand hardship life cherish opportunity learn study hard hope change fate family effort college entrance examination admitted ideal university continued work hard actively participate social practice activity constantly improve ability joined volunteer team teach impoverished area child experience deeply impressed joy significance helping graduated college entered workforce filled emotion difficulty setback precious treasure life longer timid child brave strong confident person

I thought that since I was still idle, I might as well go hiking to exercise my body and experience the feeling of ancient literati climbing to the top of the mountain and seeing the small mountains. So I packed my bags and headed straight to Mount Taishan, Shandong Province. After arriving at Tai'an, Shandong Province, where Mount Taishan is located, I went to the Confucius Temple first to get a better understanding of Confucius. Later on, I also tried some local delicacies, and most of the dishes tasted pretty good, except for a poorly made fish that made me a little nauseous. Since I want to see the top of Mount Taishan Mountain at sunrise and dawn, I will sleep in the hotel until 12:00 p.m. after dinner and prepare to climb Mount Taishan Mountain in the early morning. I purchased a disposable raincoat, flashlight, and a hiking stick in advance at the foot of the mountain. It took me almost 10 minutes to climb from the bottom to the ticket office, which further increased the difficulty of climbing down the mountain in my eyes. Although it was early in the morning when climbing Mount Taishan, there were still many tourists on the way. The sunrise of Mount Taishan Mountain can really inspire tourists to keep going with flashlights all the way, and they will not say anything about their hard work. However, I have set a goal of not sitting down and resting. Maybe it is to let me climb Mount Taishan Mountain, which makes me very excited. I really achieved this goal. When I climbed to Nantianmen, it started to rain lightly in the sky, and nearby tourists and businesses who were resting took cover. I was also grateful for preparing to buy a raincoat in advance. Although my raincoat is thin, I am already sweating all over when I climb the mountain. The cooling of the rain makes me feel at ease. After almost four to five hours, I successfully climbed to the top of the mountain. Well, unfortunately, there was a thin mist on that day, and I couldn't bear to witness the spectacular sunrise. After touring the mountaintop, I happened to board an open cable car and descend halfway up the mountain, then take a bus back to the foot of the mountain. On the way to the bus, I also fell asleep unconsciously due to excessive fatigue.",0,88,前几年我在假期里闲着无事，正好看到一些关于爬山的短视频，我想着反正闲着也是闲着，不如去爬爬山，锻炼一下身体，正好能亲身体，会一下古代文人墨客爬到山顶时的那股会当凌绝顶，一览众山小的感受。于是我收拾收拾了行李直奔山东泰山。到了泰山的所在地山东泰安后，我先去孔子庙转了转，对孔子的了解更胜一筹了。随后我也是尝了尝当地的一些美食，绝大部分的菜品味道都还不错，就是有条鱼做得非常差，让我有点反胃。由于我想看看日出破晓的泰山山顶，于是我吃完晚饭后直接在酒店睡到晚上12点，准备凌晨进行爬泰山。我在山脚下提前购买了一次性的雨衣、手电筒和一根登山杖，从最底下爬到卖票处的花了我快10分钟，就让我在在我眼中爬下山的难度再次升级。虽然爬泰山的时候是凌晨，但是一路上碰到的游客还是不少的。日出的泰山确实能激励着游客们，一路上打着手电筒不断前行，个中辛苦自不言说。不过我定了个不坐下休息的目标，也可能是让我爬泰山，让我十分的激动，我确实是完成了这个目标。等爬到南天门的时候，天空下起了小雨，附近休息的游客和商家们纷纷躲了起来，我也正庆幸着提前做好了买雨衣的准备。虽然雨衣很薄，但是我爬山早已浑身出汗，雨水的降温让我怡然自得。总共经过快四五个小时，我成功地爬到了山顶。嗯不过可惜的是当天起了薄雾，日出的壮观我难以见证。在山顶游历一番后，我也正好坐上开放的缆车下到半山腰，随后便乘大巴回到山脚。在乘坐大巴的途中，我也因为过于疲倦而不知不觉地睡着。,year idle vacation happened short video mountain climbing thought idle hiking exercise body experience feeling ancient literati climbing mountain small mountain packed bag headed straight mount taishan shandong province arriving taian shandong province mount taishan located confucius temple understanding confucius local delicacy dish tasted pretty good fish nauseous mount taishan mountain sunrise dawn sleep hotel pm dinner prepare climb mount taishan mountain early morning purchased disposable raincoat flashlight hiking stick advance foot mountain minute climb ticket office increased difficulty climbing mountain eye early morning climbing mount taishan tourist sunrise mount taishan mountain inspire tourist flashlight hard work set goal sitting resting climb mount taishan mountain excited achieved goal climbed nantianmen started rain lightly sky nearby tourist business resting cover grateful preparing buy raincoat advance raincoat sweating climb mountain cooling rain feel ease hour climbed mountain mist day bear witness spectacular sunrise touring mountaintop happened board open cable car descend halfway mountain bus foot mountain bus fell asleep unconsciously excessive fatigue

The main purpose of this trip was to visit some old friends, and Austin itself attracted me because it is known as the world's live music capital. After arriving, I couldn't wait to experience the unique charm of this city firsthand. On the first night, my friends and I walked out of the famous Sixth Street, which is known as the music heart of Austin. Around the street, there were various music sounds, and almost every bar and caf é had bands or singers performing. Different styles of music blended together, including jazz, blues, rock, and even folk, and every corner was full of vitality. There are also some street performers on the streets who attract a lot of audience during their performances. We also stopped and sat in the nearby restaurant, tasting local cuisine, watching the musicians' performances, and feeling the passionate and creative atmosphere. At night, the crowd on the streets is increasing, and everyone dances and laughs to the rhythm of the music, as if the whole city is celebrating life. The most interesting thing was that I was also pulled onto the dance floor and danced with a group of strangers. Although I am not good at dancing, the feeling of freedom and happiness completely immersed me in it. Afterwards, we went to a famous food truck park in Austin, where the food trucks offered a variety of delicacies, including Mexican Tacoma BBQ and hamburgers. I tried the very famous tower in the local area, but its taste is really wonderful. The crispy outer skin of Taco is filled with fresh and tender beef, vegetables, spices, and some other things I don't know, with a rich taste that makes me feast on it. After finishing our meal, we also had a few chilled beers and sat on the benches in the park, watching the people around us chat and gather, feeling a relaxed and happy atmosphere. Austin's cuisine, like music, is full of creativity and diversity, giving people endless surprises.",1,91,去年我有幸去德克萨斯州的奥斯汀市度过了几天，这次旅行的主要目的是去看望一些老朋友，而奥斯汀本身也因其被誉为世界现场音乐之都而吸引了我。到达之后，我迫不及待地想要亲身体验这个城市的独特魅力。在第一天的晚上，我跟朋友们出了著名的第六街，这条街啊被称为奥斯汀的音乐心脏地带，走到街上4周弥漫着各种各样的音乐声，几乎每家酒吧和咖啡馆都有乐队或歌手在演出，不同风格的音乐融合在一起，有爵士、蓝调、摇滚，甚至还有民谣，每个角落都充满了活力。街头也有一些街头艺人，他们在表演时吸引了不少观众，我们也停下了脚步坐在一旁的餐馆之中，品尝着本地的美食，看着这些音乐家们的表演，感受那种充满激情和创意的氛围。晚上街道上的人群越来越多，大家都随着音乐的节奏而跳舞欢笑，仿佛整个城市都在为生活庆祝。最有趣的是我也被拉进了舞池和一群陌生人一起跳起了舞，虽然我并不擅长跳舞，但那种自由和快乐的感觉让我完全沉浸其中。之后我们去了奥斯汀一个著名的美食美食车公园，这里的餐车提供了各种各样的美食，包括墨西哥塔可嗯烧烤和汉堡。我尝试了当地非常有名的塔，可它的味道真是美妙极了。塔可的外皮脆脆的里面填满了鲜嫩的牛肉、蔬菜、香料和一些其他我不认识的东西，口感丰富，让我大快朵颐。吃完后我们还喝了几杯冰镇啤酒，坐在公园的长椅上，看着周围的人们聊天聚会，感受到一股轻松愉快的氛围。奥斯汀的美食和音乐一样，都充满着创意和多样性，给人一种无穷的惊喜。,year privilege spending day austin texas main purpose trip visit friend austin attracted world live music capital arriving wait experience unique charm city firsthand night friend walked famous sixth street music heart austin street music sound bar caf band singer performing style music blended including jazz blue rock folk corner vitality street performer street attract lot audience performance stopped sat nearby restaurant tasting local cuisine watching musician performance feeling passionate creative atmosphere night crowd street increasing dance laugh rhythm music city celebrating life interesting pulled dance floor danced group stranger good dancing feeling freedom happiness completely immersed famous food truck park austin food truck offered variety delicacy including mexican tacoma bbq hamburger famous tower local area taste wonderful crispy outer skin taco filled fresh tender beef vegetable spice dont rich taste feast finishing meal chilled beer sat bench park watching people chat gather feeling relaxed happy atmosphere austin cuisine music creativity diversity people endless surprise

We haven't seen each other for several years, and this gathering made me very excited. He lives in the dormitory of Tianjin University, where the campus is shaded by green trees and filled with a youthful and vibrant academic atmosphere. After arriving in Tianjin, my classmate warmly took me to visit his campus. Tianjin University has both modern teaching buildings and many historic buildings. The lakes and tree lined roads on campus make people feel very comfortable. We visited the library he often goes to, where the environment is quiet and full of knowledge. He told me that many times he would spend here, burying himself in studying all day long. At lunch time, we went to a snack bar near the school to taste authentic Tianjin food, such as Goubuli steamed bun, pancakes and fruits, which gave me a big feast. My classmate also recommended Fried Dough Twists in Tianjin. In the afternoon, we went to the Fifth Avenue in Tianjin. There are many old buildings walking on the Fifth Avenue. It seems that I have gone back to the last century and felt the unique atmosphere of the combination of ancient and modern. Then we went to Jingyuan, which was the place where the last emperor Puyi once lived. Jingyuan is lined with green trees and has a blend of Chinese and Western architectural styles, which are very elegant and peaceful. We sat on the garden bench here, chatting about our future plans and dreams, as if time had returned to the days when we were still high school students. In the evening, we went to Tianjin Eye, which is a famous Ferris wheel in Tianjin. As the Ferris wheel slowly rises, the beautiful scenery of the entire city can be seen in full view. The distant Haihe River shines brightly in the sunshine, and the towering buildings and structures of the city complement each other. That moment filled me with love for this city. This trip to Tianjin not only allowed me to experience the beautiful culture of the city, but more importantly, it helped me reconnect with my old friends.

He not only taught me physics knowledge, but also made me understand the meaning of science and the attitude towards life. I heard that he moved to a nursing home after retirement, and I have always wanted to go to I found. Finally, on a winter afternoon, I embarked on this journey with full respect and entered the courtyard of the nursing home. At a glance, I saw a familiar figure. Professor Wang sat on a bench in the yard, wearing a reading gown and holding a book in his hand. He was engrossed in reading the pages with reading glasses, and the sunlight shone on his slightly hunched body, making him appear particularly quiet. Standing in front of him, I shouted softly. Teacher Wang looked up and was stunned for a moment before recognizing my smile. It was on his face and bloomed. His voice was as gentle as ever. He stood up and patted my shoulder, just like before, with warm thoughts. Finally, he led me into his room. Although it was simple, it was not very tidy. Professor Wang poured me a cup of hot tea, and we sat down by the window, chatting about our lives over the years. Professor Wang's retirement life is still very fulfilling. He persists in reading every day and even tries to write articles, organizing his decades of teaching experience. He took out a notebook and showed it to me, which was densely filled with formulas and thoughts, with clear and neat handwriting. Although his legs and feet are not as good as before, his brain still needs to be used. Learning is a lifelong pursuit. The eyes of the calligrapher and painter shone with light, and their love for knowledge moved me deeply. I am filled with emotions. We talked for a long time, from the current situation of the Spring Festival Gala to life choices. He always gently encouraged me and shared his experience. Time flies by so quickly that I had to walk with him to the door, stand under the sunset, pat my shoulder, and work hard. The future belongs to you young people. As I step out of the nursing home, the afterglow of the sunset falls on the road, and my heart is filled with emotion and strength. Professor Wang's life is like an open book. He has shown me through his actions that growth is not only about pursuing external success, but also about maintaining inner persistence and desire.

Instead, we enthusiastically continued to move forward. However, as we walked, we found ourselves lost. We didn't know the road next to us, and it was quite unfamiliar.

Although everyone is exhausted, the feeling of successfully returning to the mainland after challenging our limits is incredibly satisfying. After returning home, we all felt very fulfilled and learned many skills on how to calmly think and solve problems in difficult situations. So this trip has made me deeply realize in society that no matter how many unknown difficulties lie ahead, the important thing is not to give up and persevere, so that we can definitely clear the fog and find our way home.

We all love art, so we planned in advance to visit the UH Dante and UH exhibit. The works at the exhibition were very exciting, with many different styles of art, some of which were quite unique and left a deep impression on me. I really like an abstract painting with rich colors. Every stroke and painting in this painting is filled with strong emotions, making me unconsciously immersed in it. While I was engrossed in admiring the painting, a stranger suddenly walked up to me and started chatting with me about the background of its creation. He told me that this painting was created by himself, and I was immediately stunned. I never expected that the person in front of me might be the artist himself. After being surprised, we talked a lot and he explained every detail of the painting to me, including the choice of colors, the use of brushes, and the source of inspiration in the creative process. He also shared many experiences and challenges about artistic creation with us. Finally, he warmly invited me to participate in his personal art exhibition. I felt very surprised and lucky because this encounter not only made me understand art better, but also made me realize that behind artistic works, there is often a huge effort and emotional investment from artists.

They lived in a remote village with beautiful scenery, surrounded by undulating hills and vast fields for four weeks. I hadn't been there for a long time, so this visit made me both excited and nostalgic for the day I arrived at my grandson. My cousin drove his small tractor to pick up my village, but the road was not wide, but the scenery on both sides was very beautiful, especially the large rapeseed fields. The golden flower sea stretched endlessly, as if laying a warm blanket on the earth. My cousin enthusiastically introduced me to every change in the village along the way, such as the newly built bridge, the neighbor's newly built house, and the recent new house in the village. Although the village does not have the high-rise buildings and busy streets of the city, it has opened an agricultural product cooperative, But this peaceful and simple living atmosphere makes me feel very relaxed. After arriving home, my cousin's parents were very enthusiastic and brought me fresh fruits and homemade rice wine. My cousin's mother quickly started preparing dinner, and I saw him bring fresh vegetables from the small courtyard, which were green in color and full of vitality. The dinner was very sumptuous, with freshly cooked chicken soup, pickled vegetables, and freshly dug potatoes, especially sweet and fragrant. This meal reminded me of eating with my family when I was a child. The simple yet loving feeling seemed to take my heart back to the past. After dinner, my cousin and aunt took me to the village and the river to fish. We went fishing by the river in the village. We took bamboo poles and earthworms and walked for more than ten minutes along the field path to the small river outside the village. The river water was very clear, reflecting the blue sky and surrounding trees. The gentle breeze brushed over the water, causing ripples. I found a big stone to sit down and took the bait. Throw it into the river and wait quietly for the fish to bite. The river was very quiet, only the rustling sound of leaves being blown by the wind and the chirping of a few crickets could be heard. My cousin and I chatted about our recent situation sentence by sentence, talking about the days when we played hide and seek together as children. At that time, we were carefree and the whole world was like our amusement park. My cousin recalled the fun of us stealing grapes from our neighbor's house in those years, and he laughed heartily as he spoke. I couldn't help but laugh out loud, as if that beautiful time was right in front of us. As the night grew deeper, we didn't catch many fish, but it didn't matter. We sat under the starry sky, watching the twinkling stars and listening to the distant croaks of frogs, our hearts filled with tranquility. My cousin told me that although he lives in the countryside, he is very satisfied with this kind of life. He likes the freedom in the fields, the sense of security in working, and the warm interaction with his family and neighbors. I can feel the love for life and deep affection for his hometown in his words. That night, my cousin and I talked a lot and thought about it a lot. Although we live in different environments, the blood thicker than water bond between us has never changed. I deeply feel that although rural life does not have the bustling urban scenery, there is a kind of tranquility and warmth that cities cannot find. This visit has made me cherish this rare family bond even more, and has also made me realize that true happiness often comes from simple and authentic life.",0,99,2021年我去了一趟农村拜访我很久没见的表哥表哥一家住在偏远的乡下，那里风景优美，4周都是起伏的山丘和广阔的田野，我已经很久没去那里了，所以这次拜访让我感到既兴奋又怀念到达孙子那天，表哥开着他的小拖拉机来接我村子的路不宽，但沿途两边的景色非常美丽，尤其是那大片的油菜花田，金黄色的花海一望无际，仿佛为大地铺上了一层温暖的毯子，表哥一路上兴致勃勃的给我介绍村里的每一处变化，比如新修的桥梁，邻居家刚建好的新房，还有村里最近新开的农产品工合作社，虽然村子没有城市的高楼大厦和繁忙的街道，但这种宁静简单的生活氛围让我感到非常放松。到家后表哥的父母非常热情，给我端来了新鲜的水果和自家做的米酒。表哥的母亲很快就开始准备晚饭，我看到他从小院里带来了新鲜的蔬菜，那些蔬菜颜色翠绿充满了生机。晚餐非常丰盛，有煮的鲜嫩的鸡汤，自家腌制的咸菜，还有刚从地里挖出来的土豆，特别香甜，这顿饭让我想起了小时候和家人们一起吃饭的情景，那种简单而充满爱的感觉，似乎让我的心一下子回到了过去，吃完饭后表哥姨姨带我去村里和河边钓，村里的河边钓鱼，我们拿上竹竿和蚯蚓走了十几分钟的田间小路来到了村外的那条小河边，河水非常清澈，水面上倒映着蓝天和周围的树木，微风拂过水面，泛起层层涟漪，我找了一块大石头坐下，把鱼饵抛进河中，然后静静的等待着鱼儿上钩。河面非常安静，只能听到树叶被风吹动的沙沙声和几只蟋蟀的鸣叫声，我和表哥有一句没一句的聊着近况，聊到小时候我们一起玩捉迷藏的日子，那时候我们还小无忧无虑，整个世界都像是我们的游乐场表哥回忆起那些年我们偷吃邻居家葡萄的趣事，他说着便大笑起来，我也不禁笑出了声，仿佛那段美好的时光就在眼前，夜渐渐深了，我们没有钓到很多鱼，但这并不重要。我们坐在星空下，看着天上的星星一闪一闪，听着远处传来的几声蛙鸣，心里充满了宁静。表哥告诉我，他虽然生活在农村，但他对这样的生活很满意，他喜欢田野里的自由，喜欢劳作的踏实感，也喜欢与家人和邻里之间的温暖互动，我能感觉到他的话语中带着对生活的热爱和对家乡的深情。那一晚我和表哥谈了很多，也想了很多，虽然我们生活在不同的环境中，在彼此之间那份血浓于水的亲情始终没有改变。我深深感受到乡村生活虽然没有繁华的都市光景，却有一种城市难以找到的宁静与温情。这次拜访让我更加珍惜这段难得的亲情，也让我重新认识到真正的快乐往往来源于简单而真实的生活。,countryside visit cousin family hadnt long time lived remote village beautiful scenery surrounded undulating hill vast field week hadnt long time visit excited nostalgic day arrived grandson cousin drove small tractor pick village road wide scenery side beautiful large rapeseed field golden flower sea stretched endlessly laying warm blanket earth cousin enthusiastically introduced change village newly built bridge neighbor newly built house house village village highrise building busy street city opened agricultural product cooperative peaceful simple living atmosphere feel relaxed arriving cousin parent enthusiastic brought fresh fruit homemade rice wine cousin mother started preparing dinner bring fresh vegetable small courtyard green color vitality dinner sumptuous freshly cooked chicken soup pickled vegetable freshly dug potato sweet fragrant meal reminded eating family child simple loving feeling heart dinner cousin aunt village river fish fishing river village bamboo pole earthworm walked minute field path small river village river water clear reflecting blue sky surrounding tree gentle breeze brushed water causing ripple big stone sit bait throw river wait quietly fish bite river quiet rustling sound leaf blown wind chirping cricket heard cousin chatted situation sentence sentence talking day played hide seek child time carefree amusement park cousin recalled fun stealing grape neighbor house year laughed heartily spoke laugh loud beautiful time night grew deeper didnt catch fish didnt matter sat starry sky watching twinkling star listening distant croak frog heart filled tranquility cousin told life countryside satisfied kind life like freedom field sense security working warm interaction family neighbor feel love life deep affection hometown night cousin talked lot thought lot live environment blood thicker water bond changed deeply feel rural life bustling urban scenery kind tranquility warmth city visit cherish rare family bond realize true happiness simple authentic life
