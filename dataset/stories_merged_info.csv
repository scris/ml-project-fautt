The city of eternal daylight. And the valley of visitors. This description was vivid as though the writer had truly been there. As I do the stood there reading, an elderly woman emerged from behind there. Her silver hair was tied back neatly. And her thin blue eyes seemed to see right through me. She approached with a warm smile and said that book has been waiting for you. Her words startled me. And I laughed nervously. But seeing as she was joking, but she continue continued. It is its reader. You must take it. I hesitate. When I ask how much the book costs, she simply waved her hand and said, it's right, yours. Bewildered, but intrigued. I like the store with the book in hands. Later, I tried to find Information about the places mentioned in the text. But my searchers came up empty. Even now, the book sits on my shelf. It's serious untold. Sometimes I wonder if that bookstore and the mysterious woman were even real."
