00001.wav,Chinese,"2021年的冬天，
我回了一趟老家探望外婆，
那年他身体不好，
住在离村子不远的小镇医院里，
冬天的风特别刺骨，
我拎着一袋儿他喜欢吃的水果
走进了医院。
外婆见到我时，
脸上露出了久违的笑容，
他说，
你怎么知道我最想吃的就是橙子？
我们在病房里聊了很多，
我问他治疗的怎么样？
他却总是岔开话题，
说家里最近的事情，
比如新盖的房子，
种下的几棵果树，
我能看出他在努力表现的很坚强，
但也能感受到他眼中藏不住的疲惫。
下午的时候，
我推着他的轮椅到医院后面的花园，
冬天的阳光很淡，
却让人觉得温暖。
外婆静静地看着那些枯黄的树叶，
忽然开口问我，
你是不是觉得时间过得太快了？
我没回答。
因为我也有同样的感受。
他开始讲起年轻时候的故事，
说他当年如何背着我母亲翻过一座山去找工作，
又如何在最艰难的时候
种田养家。
我听着这些故事，
心里忽然觉得很愧疚，
愧疚于自己平时总觉得工作忙，
没时间回来看他，
而她却从未抱怨我不常回家。
离开医院的时候，
我回头看了看花园里的她
阳光落在她的白发上，
我心里想着
以后无论多忙，
我都要经常回来看她，
因为陪伴才是他最需要的东西。

云南的美景和独特文化一直是我向往的，
而这次旅行让我深深感受到它的魅力。
最让我难忘的是在洱海边骑行的一天，
那种自由和宁静的感觉至今难忘。
清晨我从大理古城租了一辆自行车，
沿着洱海的湖边小道骑行，
洱海的水面在清晨时分如镜子般平静，
倒映着周围的青山和天上的白云，
清风轻轻吹过，湖面泛起点点涟漪，
阳光洒在水面上，整个画面仿佛是从画中走出来的。
我边骑车边拍照，不时停下来欣赏眼前的美景。
一路上我遇到了许多同样骑行的游客，
有的来自南方，
有的来自国外，
大家都被洱海的宁静之美所折服。
中午我在湖边的一家小餐厅停下，
品尝了地道的云南美食，
特别是当地的烤乳扇，
外焦里嫩，奶香浓郁，让人一口难忘。
下午我继续骑行，一路欣赏洱海的不同角度，
有些地方可以看到渔船在湖面上缓缓划过，
有些地方则被稻田和小山村庄环绕，
每一处风景都令人流连忘返。
傍晚时分，我在洱海边的观景台坐下，
夕阳染红了整个湖面渔船归航的景象，安静而美丽，
我感受到一种前所未有的宁静与满足。
这次旅行不仅让我看到了洱海的美，也
让我更懂得如何在生活中找到内心的宁静。

厨师娴熟的切片，
薄脆的鸭皮和柔嫩的鸭肉把它搭配薄饼和甜面酱，
简直是味觉的盛宴。

小院子街边的小吃摊和特色小店，让我感觉到

传统和现代的创新在这里交织，
每一刻都像一段精彩的故事，我很幸运能成为它的一部分。

 with a friend. 
It's very hot in summer in Beijing, but luckily it was cloudy that day. 
The claws took part of hate the heat of us. 
So we didn't feel very hot. 
Fragrant hill. Hill was very beautiful. We chose the last step, a steep
 pass and started our mountain climbing journey, 
surrounded by many
 grain plants. 
I felt sufficient oxygen and my body seems to be lighter. 
On the way up to the mountain, we chatted and enjoy the
 uh scenery at the same time,

When we reached at the Top of the mountain, we found a place

They didn't seems to be afraid of people either
 y
 even landed beside me, shaking its little hand lightly. 
It was very cute. 
However, the way down to the mountain was not that easy. 
After walking for a while, I already felt my legs shaking. 
I couldn't help saying that I lacked exercise in my daily life. 
After going down to the mountain, we had a meal and then went back to the school. 
I felt that although climbing the mountain was a little tired, 
it was very impossible.

I joined a cultural exchange program
 that take me to the United States. 
It was my first time traveling abroad. 
And I was both nervous and excited. 
Our trip lasted 2 weeks. 
And during that time, we visited several cities, 
universities, 
and famous landmarks. 
One of the most memorable experiences
 was visiting Harvard University. 
The campus
 was exactly like what I have seen in movies. 
Historic buildings surrounded by lush greenery. 
I remember standing in front of the ironic winner library, 
taking photos
 and imagining what it would be like to study here. 
During our Guide tour, 
the student Guide shared fascinating stories of a life at Harvard, 
including the traditions and challenges, students, 
fates. 
Another unforgettable moment
 was when we visited Times Square
 in New York City, 
the bright lights, giant billboards, 
and the sheer energy of the place
 were overwhelming. 
However, 
one of the funniest incidents
 happened at local dinner. 
When I tried in order a Turkey sandwich, 
I accidentally said chicken instead. 
And when my order arrived, I was too embarrassed to correct it. 
So I just ate it critically. 
This trip was not only an opportunity to improve my English, 
but also a chains
 to learn about American culture, 
meet new friends. 
I step out of my comfort zone. 
It left a deep impression on me.

"
00021.wav,English," I want to share a story about my daily life. 
I'm a college student, and well, my days are simple. 
They are filled with my dream and melody. 
My day begins with the alarm, clocked in my dorm room. I quickly get up, fresh, up, 
and rush to the library. I love to the library. It's where my day of learning starts, sunlight, streams, so the windows and space spills onto my desk. 
Ok. 
As I
 opened my books and immersed myself in the ocean of the knowledge. 
At noon, I meet up with friends in the cafeteria. We enjoy lunch together while sharing funny stories and learning experiences. These relaxed conversations are the
 source of joy in my day. 
In the afternoon, I usually participate in extreme circular activities. 
Sometimes it's a basketball game. 
Um, sometimes it's students. 
Council meeting these activities re reached my college life. 
Um, in the evening, I take a walk on the compass, compass passes enjoying the last bit of peace. In the day, I use my phone to
 to capture the beautiful sunset or newly bloomed flowers by the
 roadside. These simple moments are precious memories for me. 
At night, I return to my dorm, 
organized my notes and prepare for the next day's classes. 
Before going to bed, I spend some time reading or writing in the in my journal, 
recording the details of the day. 
At the end of the story, I always look back on my every moment of the day when it's quiet at night. 
So each day seems ordinary. I know that this melodies of daily life were
 are waving into the most beautiful symbol of my life. 
"
00022.wav,English," The most crowded place i've ever been is Beijing underground, 
especially line ten, 
especially during the morning and evening rush hours. 
What's more torture is as I basically traveled, 
but underground every day, 
every morning and
 evening I squeezed into the underground with a car load of people. 
The metro is the fastest way to get there and still be on time. 
Since Beijing is a super metropolis and
 its resident population was
 statistically less than
20 million years ago
 with a floating population of 20 million. 
So when you think about it this way, there are definitely not enough seats
 in the underground. 
Basically, everyone goes back and grab a seat at the moment. 
The door open. 
And it is interesting to note that
 in the morning and evening rush hours, if you try to get into a carriage, 
there's a funny way to say that
 all you have to do is close your eyes and
 you don't need
 to lift your legs before you squeeze into the carriage, and you don't have to worry about
 the lack of handrails because
 there are not enough people for you
 to stand without falling down. 
Even if you are not holding to other hamburgers, because others will
 push you and squeeze you
 in a firm place.

I went to visit my cousin in New York. 
I had been so excited about this trip because I hadn't seen her in years. 
And I'd never been to New York before. 
I spent week, weeks planning everything
 from the places we'd visit
 to the restaurants we try. 
But from the moment I landed, 
things started to go wrong. 
First, 
my flight was delayed by almost 6 hours. 
I was stuck at the airport, 
feeling tired and annoyed, 
waiting with no clear idea of when I'd get to leave. 
When I finally arrived in New York, 
I discovered that my luggage had been lost. 
I had to spend over an hour at the airport, 
filling out forms and talking to airline staff. 
But nobody could tell me
 when my bag would be found. 
When I finally got to my cousin's apartment, 
I was already in in a bad mood. 
I thought we'd had a nice dinner and catch up. 
But she told me she had to work late that evening. 
So I was left on my own in a strange city. 
I ordered some takeout, 
but it wasn't very good. 
And I spent the evening the evening feeling lonely and frustrated. 
The next day, my cousin suggested we visit Central Park. 
I thought this would be the highlight of the trip, 
but it wasn't, 
as soon as we got there, 
it started raining. 
We didn't have umbrellas. 
So we ended up getting soaked. 
The park, 
which I had always imagined as a beautiful and lively, 
just felt cold and empty. 
Sam. 
We got into an argument because she thought I was being negative about everything. 
The tension between us ruined the rest of the day. 
By the time I flew back home, 
I was completely exhausted and disappointed. 
I had spent so much time and effort planning this trip, 
but nothing has gone the way I had hoped. 
I couldn't wait to leave and just forget about the whole thing. 
"

a trip to my grandparents farmhouse in the countryside. 
The anticipation of this visit always filled me with excitement. 
As I knew it promised a break from the pressure of city life. 
The moment we cross the threshold, 
I was greeted by the freshly baked bread. 
My grandmother weighs her. A prawn tied around her waist. 
Would always have a plate of warm cookies waiting for me. 
My grandfather with his wedded hands
 and wide smile
 would take me on tours of the farm, 
introducing me to the various animals
 from the curious chicken picking at the ground to the gentle cows, 
grazing in the meadow. 
Days at the farm were filled with simple joys. I spent hours in the garden, 
helping my grandmother plant flowers and vegetables, 
learning the names of each plant. 
In the afternoon, we often get around
 the old tree in the yard, 
where my grandfather would tell us
 with stories of his Youngs, 
his voice carrying the weight of experience. 
Evenings were magical as the sky transformed into a cover
 of stars. 
My grandparents would set up a makeshift telescope. 
And together we explore the wonders of the cosmos
 and dreaming of distant words. 
Those summer days at my grandparents, farmhouse were a time of poor happiness. 
They taught me the value of hard work, 
the beauty of nature and the importance of farm family bonds. 
Even now as an adult, 
those memories continues to inspire and nourish my soul.

We went to Golden Gate park where we spent hours walking through gardens, 
watching paddle both on the lake, 
and even visiting the Japanese tea garden,

We even got here
 a story happening in one of the halls. 
The sound of the orchestra was amazing

The mix of music and dance were incredible.

experience the culture and see the city that I had only ever seen in the movies. 
1:00 afternoon, 
I decided to take a walk around
 Central Park, 
the iconic park in the heart of
 Manhattan. 
The sun was shining and the park was
 bustling with people enjoying their day. 
As I walked down, one of the
 quarter pass near the edge of the park, I noticed something old. 
A dog sitting by the sidewalk, looking lost and confused. 
It was a medium sized dog with a
 scruffy coat and it seemed like it was waiting for someone. 
But no one was around. 
The dog looked up at me when sad
 eyes. And I could see that it was trying to figure out what to do next. 
I approached the dog slowly, 
hoping not to scare it. And to my surprise, it didn't run away or back at me. 
He said it wags its tail slightly, 
almost as if it was asking for help. 
I looked around, but the street was empty. 
And there was no signs of anyone
 looking for it. 
My first instinct was to help. 
So I bent down and gently
 patted the dog. 
It was shaking a little, but as soon as I started patting it, the dog seemed to calm down. 
A few minutes later, a woman appeared around the corner, calling the dog's name. 
The dog immediately
 perked up and ran to toward her. 
She looked incredibly relieved and explained that the dog had slipped out of her house. 
Earlier that the day
 and have been missing for hours. 
She thanked me profusely for staying with her dog and for keeping it calm
 until she arrived. 
I felt an overwhelming sense of worth and happiness. 
Knowing that I had played a small role
 in reuniting the dog with its owner, 
it's it was such a simple act of kindness, but it made me realize how much of the difference more decisions can make in someone's life. 
That day I walked away with a sense of
 fulfillment. 
Knowing that sometimes being kind and offering a little help can make the world a better place.

And so then we go to the

Uh um II would say I feel a bit a little bit disappointed when I asked. 
I see the Tianjin eyes because it's far more smaller than the London eyes. 
And then, you know, it's not really shock when I see it on and on the internet. 
Uh, but then

Breakfast.

When we left, I feel a bit a little bit disappointed
 and a little bit sad, because we have never

But I do believe we can have more time to stay

my sister and I went to Hong Kong. 
And one of the highlights of our trip was visiting LAN kuifeng. 
A popular bar district
 district. 
It was our first time there. 
And we were excited to experience the
 vibrant nightlife that we had heart

The narrow streets were filled with people. 
And the energy was electric

The atmosphere was lively with people dancing,

My sister and I ordered some drinks and drowned
 in the farm. 
We danced last and even made a few new friends who were also visited from other places.

00038.wav,Chinese,"嗯我和几个同学在2017年的夏天自驾去了长白山，
走的是公路，所以路途比较长，沿途的风景交错变化，有树、铁路、草地，
时不时还能看到几条小河，
一路上有说有笑，所以车程不算特别无聊。
抵达吉林省我们第一件事就是品去品尝当地的铁锅炖，虽然铁锅炖冬天吃更有感觉，但去都去了，夏天闷得满头是汗也得尝一口，
那里精心搭配好的酱汁，将各种配菜都煮烂包裹在一个大面饼里，
就着米饭现在想想都还意犹未尽。
随后我们又去了长白山，
因为那里比较凉爽的天气让我们短暂逃离了北京的蒸炉，景色很优美，
郁郁葱葱的树林里面，而且空气很清新，穿梭在云雾之间，感觉像在仙境里一样。
然后侧面还有山泉留下几只鹰盘旋飞过，
在那里仿仿佛接受了来自大自然的拥抱。
之后我们去吃了东北烧烤，
那里的烤串是一大特色，
据说东北人是没有不会烤串的，
然后肉量和菜品都特别实诚，火火候掌握的刚刚好，
不像那些地摊小贩儿做的
又瘦又硬的肉串儿，我们吃到的串儿都可以用鲜香肥美来形容，
就肥瘦相间，冒着热气，然后还能发出点滋啦滋啦的声音。
现在想想还是会流口水。
然后我们还尝了几大当地的特色菜肴，比如说地三鲜锅包肉，还有溜肉段，
这些菜虽然各地外卖都能吃得到，但真正到了东北咱们才能吃到最正宗的味道。
现炒上桌还能拿出搪瓷的锅包肉，
然后看起来黑乎乎一盘的地三鲜，但其中每一个菜块都沾上了勾好芡的酱汁，
然后又是一个下饭绝配。
那里的嗯菜品价格比较便宜，而且绝不缺斤少两，老板都特别热情，
在等菜期间还会给我们送自家腌制的小菜啊或者是开胃的凉拌菜，
也和我们唠了唠家常。
在与老板的沟通交流中，连我们说话的口音都变得有点东北味，还是东北对人
对人口音的影响大。
这次旅行有旅途上小打小闹，又站在长白山上时的心旷神怡，
还有地道东北菜带来的极致享受，算是一个享受或者治愈的旅途吧。

2023年的夏天，我邀请嗯然后嗯我和我的

不算是一个故乡，因为我每次得坐高铁才能到这里来，但这一次
嗯不一样的是我就在这上学，所以我不需要坐高铁。
我们大概玩了有一个星期左右的时间，嗯
当初一开始准备的是跟团游，但是后来我们想了一下，因为照顾到团队里就是很多老人跟小孩，
所以最后我们决定是选择一个叫携程的定制游，
就是包车我记得当时一共花了差不多有几好几万块，
感觉还是挺贵的，但是体验的话
其实也没有那么好，因为
跟团游当时
发生了一些不太好的事情，
比如说因为嗯一些交通的管制呀车辆，我们当时包的车不能及时的
到达我们这里，还有就是
嗯司机可能有点偷懒，不想来接我们，
所以虽然给他钱了，但他没有给我们认真工作，最后呢携程也给我们一些补偿。
嗯那你要问我开不开心吧？
嗯其实一般般，因为
虽虽然他给我补偿了，但是
感觉还是有点亏，最后我们也去了不少地方，
嗯来了北京人大学，还有一些长城呀，故宫呀，
还有很多其他的地方，
然后我发现这个很多地方其实都不是很好抢票，抢票的话都要拼手速，
印象最深的地方应该是环球影城，
嗯环球影城还是挺好玩的，
里面有很独詹欢的电影角色，
嗯小黄人还有一些其他的东西，感觉还是挺好玩的。
嗯嗯。
呃嗯
我记得最后一天的话，我们去的那个是故宫，其实觉得最后一天去故宫其实不太合适，但是还是最后一天去了，因为
因为你知道抢票很难。
嗯所以最后一天去故宫的时候，我记得当时好像还有人穿皇帝的衣服进去拍照，我觉得这个
这个想法还挺新奇的。
嗯嗯。
嗯总的来说这是一次还不错的旅行，但是也有一些
不太好的事情吧。

00042.wav,Chinese,"啊那是一个充满期待的日子。
啊我终于亲自去到了美国参加了一场NBA的比赛，
不仅如此，我还获得了一个与篮球巨星勒布朗詹姆斯见面的机会，
这一切听起来像是一个梦境，但是当我站在洛杉矶的斯台普斯中心门前时，我几乎不敢相信自己的眼睛。
我一直是詹姆斯的忠实粉丝，从他刚进联盟的那个赛季开始，我就一直关注着他的比赛，见证了他从
克利夫兰到迈阿密，
再到回到克利夫兰，
再到最终加入洛杉矶湖人获得多个总冠军的辉煌历程，
能够亲眼见到他，甚至与他面对面交流，
对我来说简直是无与伦比的荣耀。
那天我早早的来到比赛场地，空气中弥漫着兴奋与紧张的气氛，
湖人队将对阵勇士，
球迷们聚集在门外外面，
兴奋的讨论着比赛的预测和球员的表现，终于工作人员带我进入了专门为媒体和VIP嘉宾准备的区域，这里可以近距离观察到球队的准备过程。
当我走进球员更衣室的走廊时，突然听到了一阵沉重的脚步声，我转身眼前就出现了那位从小就崇拜的篮球巨星
勒布朗詹姆斯，他穿着湖人队的训练服，手上拿着一瓶水正走向训练场地，
虽然他看起来非常专注，但当他看到我时微微一笑，似乎对我并不陌生，
我们开始讨论篮球，也聊到了他个人的生活，
他告诉我除了篮球场的挑战，
家庭和社会责任是他人生中最重要的部分。
他提到作为一名运动员，他有时也会面临巨大压力，
但他始终相信通过团队的支持和不懈努力，一切困难都能够克服。
我问他，
在你漫长的职业生涯中，什么时候让你觉得最为骄傲？詹姆斯、陈斯鲁潘尼克
微微笑着回答，
我最大的骄傲就是能够为我的家乡克利夫兰带回那个总冠军广杯，
那是我们团队奋斗的结果，也是我职业生涯中最难忘的一刻。
赢得总冠军不只是为了我自己，而是为了那些一直支持我的球迷和家乡的人。
在短短的交流中，詹姆斯就给我留下了深刻的印象，他的谦逊专注，
他对篮球的热爱远远超出了我对他的认识，
他不仅是场上的超级巨星，场下的他也充满治水和人情味。
当我与她告别时，我感到一种难以言喻的满足感，
能够与詹姆斯这样的伟大运动员面对面交流，是我人生中最宝贵的经历之一。尽管我知道像詹姆斯这样的人物可能一生只有那么一次偶遇，
但他那份专注和热情的精神
将永远激励我不断追求自己的梦想。
比赛开始了，我坐在场边，
眼睛紧紧盯着球上的每一刻，
詹姆斯在场上表现如同平常一样令人惊叹，而在场外的那一刻，他的真诚和谦逊也深深的触动了我。
That's all thank you。

我们沿着湖边的步道慢慢走着，感受着清新的空气和悠闲的氛围。
湖边的柳树随风摇曳，仿佛在向我们招手，
周围还可以听到小鸟的叫声，整个环境非常宁静。
朋友和我在湖边聊了许多，谈起了彼此这些年的生活变化，

远处的雷峰塔渐渐地映入眼帘，
像一幅古代的画卷般美丽动人。
那一刻我真的感到非常放松，好像所有的烦恼都消失了。
游览完西湖之后，朋友还带我去品尝了杭州的特色美食，东坡肉。
我们在一家老字号的餐馆里点了这道菜，
东坡肉，入口即化，肥而不腻，味道真的特别香浓。
朋友还和我讲了这道菜背后的故事，据说是苏东坡当年创造的，
真的非常有趣。
吃完饭后我们又去了一个茶馆，杭州的龙井茶特别有名，
我们点了几杯坐在茶馆里慢慢品味，看着窗外的夜景渐渐降临，湖面上灯光闪烁，映出一片宁静的美景，
那种感觉很温馨，也让我对杭州有了更深的喜爱。

我刚刚从初中毕业，
于是我和母亲一同踏上了向往已久的英国之旅。
在出发前，我通过唐顿庄园、皇冠、维多利亚女王等英剧，
对英国的历史和文化有了初步的了解和浓厚的兴趣。
这些剧集让我对英国的贵族生活，王室历史和维多利亚时代的辉煌有了直观的感受。
我们的旅程从伦敦开始，
这座城市以其丰富的历史遗迹和文化氛围而闻名。
尽管我们到达时，
大本钟正在维修，未能一睹其全貌，但这并没有减少我们对这个城市的热爱。
我们在伦敦的街头漫步，感受着这座城市独特的魅力，乘坐游轮在泰晤士河上缓缓前行，两岸的风光如同一幅幅流动的画
画卷，
让人目不暇接。
我们参观历史悠久的皇家海军学院，探访了格林尼治天文台，
还参观了圣保罗大教堂和威斯敏斯特大教堂，
这些建筑的宏伟与精致让我们对英国的宗教和建筑艺术有了更深的认识。
伦敦的天气
晴天很难一见，大多数都是灰蒙蒙的，阴天偶尔还会下起小雨，
但这并没有影响我们的游览兴致，
反而增添了一份英伦风情。
雨中的伦敦有着别样的浪漫和诗意，
我们撑着伞穿梭在古老的街道上，
仿佛自己也成为了那些英剧中的一员。
在伦敦的行程结束后，我们又前往了苏格兰的首府爱丁堡，
这座城市以其古老的城堡，狭窄的街道和丰富的文化活动而闻名。
在爱丁堡，我们仿佛穿越回了中世纪，感受到了苏格兰的历史和文化。
我们参观了爱丁堡城堡，了解了苏格兰的王室历史，
还漫步在皇家英里大道上，感受着这座城市的活力与魅力。
这次英国之旅不仅让我亲身体验了英国的历史和文化，也让我对这个世界有了更深的理解和认识。
每一座城市，每一座建筑，
每一条街道都承载着故事，
讲述着历史，
这些经历如同宝贵的财富，
会永远珍藏在我的记忆中。

每一天都让我感到兴奋和满足。
第一天我来到了大阪的环球影城，
这个地方总是在我的计划清单中，
当我进入园区的哈利波特区时，
整个人都激动的快跳起来了。
电影中那个宏伟壮观的霍格沃兹城堡此刻真真实实地矗立在我眼前，
那种感觉简直难以置信，我走在小路上仿佛真的进入了魔法世界，
连周围的空气都好像变得有魔力。
接着我去了小黄人去，
这里有一个非常有趣的VR体验项目，
在游玩过程中，我觉得自己好像在天上飞翔，
穿梭于各种场景之中，
但实际上我只是坐在原地，这个项目让我充分感受到了科技的魅力，
既惊险又好玩，晚上我非常幸运地赶上了一场花鼓大会，
烟花在夜空中绽放，五光十色，伴随着打上花火这首音乐，
整个夜晚仿佛都被点亮了。
烟花的美丽让我不禁感慨，这一刻的景色将永远印刻在我的记忆中。
第二天我来到了奈良公园，
这是一个著名的景点，
园区里有许多小路，

能够与这些动物零距离接触，让我感受到人与自然的和谐，
也让我这一天充满温暖。

在通往山脚的路上，我们经过了著名的音乐公路，
车轮碾过路面时，竟然真的奏响了一首美妙的旋律。

00060.wav,English," In 2022, 
I visited my great grandfather for the first time. 
He lived in a small, quiet village surrounded by green hills and fields. 
Despite being over 90 years old, 
he was still remarkably sharp and full of energy. 
I had heard many stories about him from my family, 
but meeting him in person feel like a connection to a new chapter of my heritage. 
As we sat in his living room, 
drinking tea, he had prepared. 
I asked him about my grandfather's childhood. 
His face lit up with a warm smile as he began to recall the past. 
Your grandfather was a naughty boy, he said, 
drinking the tea. 
But he had a heart of gold. 
I remember one time
 when he was about 7 years old, 
he tried to help me plant rice in the field
 instead of planting the seedlings in the right place, 
he scattered them all over the place. 
When I asked him what he was doing, 
he told me he wanted rice plants
 to be Free to grow wherever they liked. 
We both laughed at the photo of my young grandfather running around the field, 
completely unaware of the chores he was causing. 
My grief. 
Grandfather then told me about the time. 
When my grandfather saved a
 small dog, 
he found it shivering in the rain one day
 and brought it home, 
hiding it in his room. 
Because
 he thought I wouldn't let him keep it. 
When I discovered it, 
he begged me to let the dog stay. 
Promising. He would take care of it. 
I couldn't say no to his determination. 
Hearing these stories. 
I felt as though I was meeting a different version of my grandfather, 
one boy who was playful
 kind and full of dream. 
My great grandfather's eyes
 sparked as he spoke, 
his voice carrying the weight of love and pride. 
That day, 
I learn so much more than just a few stories. 
I gained a deeper understanding of my family's values and history. 
It was a visit that left lasting is impression on my heart. 
And I promised myself
 to cherish the story and wisdom passed down through generations.

00061.wav,English," Last summer
 to visit my childhood home
 for the last time before it was sold. 
The house, 
which had always been a place of comfort and memories, 
was now empty. 
As I walked through the rooms, 
each space seemed to equal with the laughter
 and the events that had shaped my life. 
I stood in the living room, 
remembering the family dinners and gatherings
 that once filled it with warps, 
the familiar smell of old furniture, 
and the breaking of the floors, 
bought everything rushing back. 
The hardest part
 was going into my old bedroom. 
It looks so different now. 
Empty of all the things I had felt it
 with over the years. 
I walked to the wooden floorboard where as a child, 
I had covered my name
 with a small knife. 
I hadn't thought about it
 in years. 
But as I run my finger over the group, 
I felt a deep sense of
 nostalgia. 
It was like saying goodbye
 to a part of myself. 
Afterwards, 
I went out to the garden. 
It was there. I spent countless hours playing as a child, 
and I couldn't live without taking something with me. 
I picked up a small rock from the ground, 
a simple gesture, 
but it felt like taking a piece of the place with me. 
I split it into my pocket, 
knowing it would remind me of the house. 
One, I could no longer return. 
It was a deeply emotional day. 
As I locked the door behind me for the last time, 
I realized it was
 closing the chapter on an important part of my life. 
The house had shaped who I was
 and living. It felt like living behind a piece of my childhood. 
It wasn't just a house, 
but it was a memory. 
The people
 and the mountain
 that has made its form, 
saying goodbye was harder than I had imagined. 
But I know it was time to let go.

the scent of age, paper and laser building, 
enveloped me like a worm hog. 
I have visited this place countless times
 as a child, 
often dragging my mother alone, 
lost in the world of stories. 
Today I was returning alone, 
searching for a piece of my past. 
The shopkeeper
 MR. Wang was still there. 
His silver hair and gentle smile unchanged. 
He looks up from behind the counter. 
His eyes lighting up.

Always looking for adventure stories.

It was the last book she read to me before she passed away. 
Tears brimmed in my eyes as I held it to
 close as I held it close. 
Thank you, mister.

He smiled knowingly. 
Books have a way of keeping memories alive
 as alive as I left. 
The weight of sadness lifted slightly, 
replaced by worms
 of cherished memories.

 fresh sea and the sounds of the waves, my cousin was waiting for me and we spent the afternoon catching up. 
The horse was cozy
 with lots of plan, 
plants and big windows, 
where you could see the

Every morning I woke up early and wake up
 and walk along the beach at that time. 
The beach was almost
 empty and it feels like it was just for us. 
The sand was
 cool under our feet and the waves touched our tones as we walked. 
Sometimes
 we would pick up
 seashells and I loved seeing the different colors and shapes. It was such a simple thing to do, but I
 made me feel really happy and relaxed one day.

我下定决心和朋友一起去探索一番。
当我们抵达村庄的时候已经是傍晚时分了，
这个村庄坐落于一片茂密的竹林深处，
房屋都是用木材和青砖建成的，
看起来像是从古代保存下来的遗迹，
村子里很少用电，家家户户主要还是靠油灯来照明。
村民们对外来的游客经常感到十分好奇，
但他们都十分友善，有有几有有几位村民邀请我到他们家用餐休息，
饭后老人开始讲述一个村庄的传说，
传说这个村庄曾是一个隐士的栖息地，
他有一种神奇的能力可以用竹笛召唤山间的动物。
据说这种吱笛声不仅可以引来鹿和鸟，还能够治愈受伤的动物，

但后来我们的计划改变了，
我们去了陕西省的另一个市宝鸡市，
因为我们考虑到了西安
人太多，
因为节假日人太多了，所以我们就去了其他市，
并且他已经是逛腻了西安，
所以我们就一致决定去个新地方，宝鸡市。
我们从西安到宝鸡来回买了站票，主要是硬座卖光了，宝鸡不愧是18线小城市，
同样规格的酒店在北京得贵好几倍，
到站后映入眼帘的是荒凉，看到了正在建设中的马路和高楼，
果然这边的网约车十分不方便，
特别难约，但是出租车又太贵了。
于是我们坐公交出去玩，
公交车同样也是破破烂烂的，
那时还是大大大夏天
天气非常炎热，
车内连空调都不舍得开，
唯一值得去的地方就是青铜博物馆了。
我们到青铜博物馆的时候已经很累了，
尽管青铜博物馆看起来特别的宏伟，
但是的话我们已经没有精力去逛了，
于是我们就找了个座位休息了一会儿，
参观的心情都没了。
最后我们走马观花的看了一遍，
印象最深的只有他的那个

随后我们就回酒店了，
我们一到酒店
根本就不想出去了，
而且好久没有见面了，于是我们俩就在酒店里待了两天，
玩两天游戏，
白天睡午觉，睡到中午点个外卖，
然后打游戏到深夜这一趟我们就去了个青铜博物馆，
最后离开的时候，我们就去了一下热闹的夜市，想吃一些小吃，弥补一下遗憾，
结果这边的小吃同质化过于严重，
没有什么特色。
排了很久的烤猪蹄，结果味道很一般，只能用索然无味来形容。
我们等了很久的敏欣也是
不加辣椒什么味道都没有，
但是加了后辣椒后却只剩一点辣味了，
自己的游玩只能用些许遗憾来形容，

也去了楼外楼的杭州菜，尝了尝当地的杭州菜，
也去了小吃街，尝了各种各样的点心，尤其是定胜糕短短几天的杭州之行，让我体会到了江南的温柔与韵味。
虽然离开时心里有些不舍，
但我知道这段记忆会永远留在我的心底。

It was my first time in this in this city. 
And I was excited to his role in history and culture. 
I started my trip by walking the freedom trails, 
a path, a path that take me, take you through some of most historic
 side in the city, 
along the way, 
I saw a famous program, 
a rivers house and old North church. 
And I learned a lot about the American
 revolution. 
I also serve as
 final. 
How? 
Where I heard street performers playing Jazz music, 
the south of their
 its instrument
 mixed with the chatter of stories, 
created a lively atmosphere. 
The next day, 
I visited Harvard University
 in the nearby. 
Cambridge, 
walking through the campus. 
I felt a sense of inspiration. It was like stepping into a world where ideas and innovations through
3. 
I spent some time in the Harvard Museum of Natural History, 
looking at habits of fossil and dinosaur skeletons. 
The museum was quiet, 
and the air inside smell like old wood and dust, 
which made it feel even more like a place of Discovery. 
In the evening, 
I had dinner as a small seafood restaurant by the harbor, 
enjoying a place of fresh lobster while watching the sunset all over the water. 
The city has a vibrant, red crown, calm energy. 
And it's made me realize how much there is
 to learn. 
And its parents in places with such deep
 history.

00087.wav,Chinese,"小时候我是一个极其内向的孩子，
在班级里我总是默默的坐在角落里看着同学们嬉笑玩耍，
自己却不敢加入其中，
我害怕被拒绝，
害怕出丑，
这种恐惧如影随形，使我错过了许多美好的时光。
记得有一次班级里组织了一场演讲比赛，
看着同学们一个个自信满满走上讲台，声情并茂的演讲，
我心中充满了羡慕，
我多么希望自己也能像他们一样勇敢地站在众人面前
表达自己的想法。
然而当老师问到我是否愿意参加时，我却低下头不敢回答，
我害怕自己会紧张的说不出话来，
害怕同学们会嘲笑我的
胆怯。
这次经历让我对自己更加失望，我觉得自己是一个失败者，
但是命运的转折
往往在不经意间出现，
那是一个阳光明媚的下午。
我在图书馆偶然看到一本关于勇气和成长的书，
书中的主人公从一个胆小怕事的人逐渐成长为一个
勇敢坚强的人，
他的故事深深地打动了我，
我开始反思自己，为什么
我不能像他一样勇敢的面对自己的恐惧呢？
我决定改变自己。
从那之后我开始主动与同学们交流，
虽然一开始很紧张，
但我强迫自己坚持下去。
我参加了学校的社团社团活动，
尝试着在众人面前发表自己的意见，
慢慢的我发现自己不再那么害怕与人交往了，
我的自信心也逐渐增强。
然而成长的道路并非一帆风顺，
在我上高中的时候家庭遭遇了一场重大的变故，
父亲的生意失败，家里陷入了经济困难，
看着父母为了生活奔波劳累，
我心中充满了愧疚和不安，
我觉得自己应该为家庭承担一些责任，
于是我开始利用课余时间打工赚钱。
那段日子虽然很辛苦，但是也让我学会了
坚强和独立。
我明白了生活的不易，也更加珍惜每一个学习的机会。
我努力学习，希望能通过自己的努力改变家庭的命运。
高考结束后我考上了一所理想的大学，
在大学里我继续努力奋斗，积极参加各种社会实践活动，
不断提升自己的能力。
我还加入了志愿者团队去贫困地区
支教，
帮助那些需要帮助的孩子。
这段经历让我深刻地体会到了帮助他人的快乐和意义。
如今我已经大学毕业走上了工作岗位，
回首过去我感慨万千，
那些曾经的困难和挫折如今都成了我人生中宝贵的财富。
我不再是那个胆小怕事的孩子，
而是一个
勇敢坚强自信的人。

我想着反正闲着也是闲着，不如去爬爬山，锻炼一下身体，正好能亲身体，会一下古代文人墨客爬到山顶时的那股
会当凌绝顶，一览众山小的感受。
于是我收拾收拾了行李直奔山东泰山。
到了泰山的所在地山东泰安后，我先去孔子庙转了转，
对孔子的了解更胜一筹了。
随后我也是尝了尝当地的一些美食，
绝大部分的菜品味道
都还不错，
就是有条鱼做得非常差，让我有点反胃。
由于我想看看日出破晓的泰山山顶，
于是我吃完晚饭后直接在酒店睡到
晚上12点，
准备凌晨进行爬泰山。
我在山脚下提前购买了一次性的雨衣、手电筒和一根登山杖，
从最底下爬到卖票处的花了我快10分钟，
就让我在在我眼中爬下山的难度再次升级。
虽然爬泰山的时候是凌晨，但是一路上
碰到的游客还是不少的。
日出的泰山确实能激励着游客们，
一路上打着手电筒不断前行，
个中辛苦自不言说。
不过我定了个不坐下休息的目标，也可能是让我爬泰山，让我十分的激动，
我确实是完成了这个目标。
等爬到南天门的时候，天空下起了小雨，
附近休息的游客和商家们纷纷躲了起来，
我也正庆幸着提前
做好了买雨衣的准备。
虽然雨衣很薄，
但是我爬山早已浑身出汗，雨水的降温让我怡然自得。
总共经过快四五个小时，
我成功地爬到了山顶。
嗯不过可惜的是当天起了薄雾，日出的壮观我难以见证。
在山顶游历一番后，我也正好坐上开放的缆车下到半山腰，随后便乘大巴回到山脚。
在乘坐大巴的途中，我也因为过于疲倦而不知不觉地睡着。

孙子那天，
表哥开着他的小拖拉机来接我村子的路不宽，但沿途两边的景色非常美丽，
尤其是那大片的油菜花田，
金黄色的花海一望无际，仿佛
为大地铺上了一层
温暖的毯子，表哥一路上兴致勃勃的给我介绍村里的每一处变化，比如新修的桥梁，
邻居家刚建好的新房，还有村里最近新开的农产品工合作社，
虽然村子没有城市的高楼大厦和繁忙的街道，但这种宁静简单的生活氛围让我感到非常
放松。
到家后表哥的父母非常热情，给我端来了新鲜的水果和自家做的米酒。
表哥的母亲很快就开始准备晚饭，
我看到他从小院里
带来了新鲜的蔬菜，那些蔬菜颜色翠绿充满了生机。
晚餐非常丰盛，有煮的鲜嫩的鸡汤，自家腌制的咸菜，还有刚从地里挖出来的土豆，
特别香甜，这顿饭让我想起了小时候和家人们一起吃饭的情景，
那种简单而充满爱的感觉，似乎让我的心一下子回到了过去，吃完饭后表哥
姨姨带我去村里和河边钓，
村里的河边钓鱼，我们拿上竹竿和蚯蚓
走了十几分钟的田间小路来到了村外的那条小河边，
河水非常清澈，
水面上倒映着蓝天和周围的树木，
微风拂过水面，泛起层层涟漪，我找了一块大石头坐下，
把鱼饵抛进河中，然后静静的等待着鱼儿上钩。
河面非常安静，只能听到树叶被
风吹动的沙沙声和几只蟋蟀的鸣叫声，我和表哥有一句没一句的聊着近况，
聊到小时候我们一起玩捉迷藏的日子，那时候我们还小无忧无虑，整个世界都像是我们
的游乐场表哥回忆起那些年我们偷吃邻居家葡萄的趣事，他说着便大笑起来，我也不禁笑出了声，
仿佛那段美好的时光就在眼前，夜渐渐深了，我们没有钓到很多鱼，但这并不重要。
我们坐在
星空下，看着天上的星星一闪一闪，听着远处传来的几声蛙鸣，心里充满了宁静。
表哥告诉我，他虽然生活在农村，但他对这样的生活很满意，
他喜欢田野里的自由，喜欢劳作的踏实感，
也喜欢与家人和邻里之间的温暖互动，我能感觉到他的话语中带着对生活的热爱和对家乡的深情。
那一晚我和表哥谈了很多，也想了很多，虽然我们生活在不同的环境中，在彼此之间那份血浓于水的亲情始终没有改变。
我深深感受到乡村生活虽然没有繁华的都市光景，却有一种城市难以找到的宁静与温情。
这次拜访让我更加珍惜这段难得的亲情，也让我重新认识到真正的快乐往往来源于简单而真实的生活。
